## Preface {#preface .unnumbered}

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) are systematically developed statements that assist healthcare providers in deciding on appropriate treatments for specific clinical problems. They usually reflect the consensus on the optimal treatment options within a health system and aim at beneficially influencing prescribing behaviour at all levels of care.

Health systems, particularly in developing countries, are faced with growing health needs on one hand and limited resources on the other. Policy makers at various levels are therefore engaged in designing cost- effective health interventions that ensure accessible and affordable quality care for all, in particular the poor and vulnerable groups.

Inappropriate prescribing is one of the manifestations of irrational medication use behaviour. It occurs when medicines are not prescribed in accordance with guidelines that are based on scientific evidence to ensure safe, effective, and economic use. STGs provide the tool for health care providers to give quality standardised care at affordable cost.

For Ghana's growing National Health Insurance Scheme, a standard treatment guideline is seen as a cost containment tool to ensure that inefficiencies, fraud and poly-pharmacy, often associated with Health Insurance Schemes, are minimised.

Regular, objective and transparent reviews of STGs are very important because the development process is a continual effort and not limited to a one-time production. This process includes gaining acceptance of the concept and preparing the text for wide consultation and consensus building. This is to ensure that users identify with and collectively own the process of development.

This document is the seventh edition of the Ministry of Health's officially approved prescribers' and dispensers' guide for all levels of healthcare. Great effort has been put into aligning the prevailing health insurance benefits package to this edition. The official release of this edition would be the e-copy, available at [http://www.ghndp.org.This](http://www.ghndp.org.This/) edition is also available on compact disk.

The Ministry of Health is particularly grateful to its development partners, experts, and other stakeholders for their continuous support to the health sector.

I am confident that all users of this document would find this edition very useful.

Minister for Health

The Government of Ghana, through the National Medicine Policy, remains committed to ensuring the availability of and accessibility to, affordable and good quality medicines for all Ghanaians; and it is expected that these medicines would be used rationally. Achieving these objectives require a comprehensive strategy that not only includes supply and distribution, but also appropriate and thoughtful prescribing, dispensing and use of medicines.

The Ministry of Health since 1983 has been publishing a list of Essential Drugs with Therapeutic Guidelines to aid the rational use of drugs. This document has been reviewed in response to new knowledge on drugs and diseases and changes in the epidemiology of diseases in Ghana. The Ministry has also produced guidelines for specific disease control programmes, diseases and identifiable health providers.

The Standard Treatment Guidelines have been prepared as a tool to assist and guide prescribers (including doctors, medical assistants, and midwives), pharmacists, dispensers, and other healthcare staff who prescribe at primary care facilities in providing quality care to patients. The guidelines list the preferred treatments for common health problems experienced by people in the health system and were subjected to stakeholder discussions before being finalised to ensure that the opinion of the intended users were considered and incorporated.

The guidelines are designed to be used as a guide to treatment choices and as a reference book to help in the overall management of patients, such as when to refer. The guidelines are meant for use at all levels within the health system, both public and private.

It is recognised that the treatment guidance detailed in this book may differ from current practice. It is emphasised that the choices described here have the weight of scientific evidence to support them, together with the collective opinion of a wide group of recognised national and international experts. The recommendations have been rated on the following basis:

Evidence Rating A -- requires at least one randomised control trial as part of a body of scientific literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendation.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Evidence Rating B -- requires the availability of well-conducted clinical studies but no randomised clinical trials on the topic of recommendation. Evidence Rating C -- requires evidence obtained from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities. This indicates an absence of directly applicable clinical studies

of good quality.

To use treatment other than those recommended here may have to be justified to colleagues, managers, or in law.

The content of these treatment guidelines will undergo a process of continuous review. Comments or suggestions for improvement are welcome. Those comments or suggestions for addition of diseases should include evidence of prevalence as well as a draft treatment guideline using the format set out in this book. In the case of a request for a new drug or replacing a listed product with another product, the evidence base must be clearly defined and included with the request.

These suggestions should be sent to: The Programme Manager

Ghana National Drugs Programme

Ministry of Health

PO Box MB 582

Accra, Ghana West Africa

Website: [www.ghndp.org](http://www.ghndp.org/)

To use these guidelines effectively, it is important that you become familiar with the contents. Take time to read the book and understand the content and layout.

The contents of this book have been arranged in approximately alphabetical order of 'body systems'. Within each section, a number of disease states, which are significant in Ghana have been identified. For each of these disease states the structuring of the information and guidance has been standardised to include a brief description of the condition or disease and the more common signs and symptoms. In each case the objectives of treatment have been set out, followed by recommended non-pharmacological as well as the pharmacological treatment choices.

The choice of treatment guidance used here is based on the principles of 'evidence based medicine'. That is, it is based on the international medical and pharmaceutical literature, which clearly demonstrates the efficacy of the treatment choices.

The treatment guidelines try to take the user through a sequence of diagnosis, treatment, treatment objectives, and choice of treatment

> **Introduction**

and review of outcome. Prescribers are strongly recommended to adopt a similar approach to practice. Care should be taken to avoid symptomatic management of uncertain diagnoses.

When treating patients, the final responsibility for the well-being of the individual patient remains with the prescriber. Prescribers must take steps to ensure that they are competent to manage the most common conditions presenting at their practice and familiarise themselves particularly with those aspects of the treatment guidelines relating to those conditions. It is important to remember that the guidance given in this book is based on the assumption that the prescriber is competent to handle patients at this level, including the availability of diagnostic tests and monitoring equipment.

This edition uses the Recommended International Non-Proprietary Name (rINN) in line with WHO recommendations and practice. In most cases, the British Approved Name (BAN) and rINN are similar but in a few instances there are differences. Where these differences occur, the BAN has been put in parentheses to permit easy reference.

The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) operates with a defined benefits package and reimburses healthcare providers for services rendered to its members according to the treatment protocols outlined in the STG. It is important for prescribers to be adept with the benefit package and also with the operational manuals of the scheme to ensure members benefit appropriately and facilities receive full payment for services rendered.

The Tariff Operational Manual and the NHIS Medicines List (NHIS ML) are important reference documents for service providers. They indicate the individual conditions that are covered, the medicines available on the scheme's formulary and the tariffs to be used for billing.

Prescribers must note that for every condition that is covered, there are medicines listed in the NHIS ML in line with the STG recommendations. In addition, the NHIS ML states the level of prescribing attached to each medicine as indicated in the Essential Medicines List of the MOH.

Medicines should be prescribed by the generic names on the ML and prescribers must indicate the quantity of medicines to be supplied on the prescription. This is a normal requirement for prescribing and will be very helpful in claims processing for reimbursement.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

These guidelines also make provision for referral of patients to other health facilities. Patients should be referred when the prescriber is not able to manage the patient either through lack of personal experience or the availability of appropriate facilities. Patients should be referred, in accordance with agreed arrangements, to facilities where the necessary competence, diagnosis and support facilities exist. The patient should be given a letter or note indicating the problem and what has been done so far, including laboratory tests and treatment. When indicated, emergency treatment must be given before referring the patient. It may also be necessary for the patient to be accompanied by a member of health staff and it should be remembered that the act of referral does not remove from the prescriber the responsibility for the well-being of the patient.

The following are abbreviations commonly used in general prescribing of medicines. While several of them may be found in this treatment guideline, it has not been necessary to use all of them in the text of this book.

> \* medicines written as p.o. or oral could be tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions or syrups.

Medicines should be prescribed only when they are necessary in treatment following a clear diagnosis. Not all patients need a prescription for a medicine; non-pharmacological treatment may be suitable and this has been highlighted in these guidelines.

In all cases the benefit of administering the medicine should be considered in relation to the risk involved. This is particularly important during pregnancy where the risk to both mother and foetus must be considered.

Prescriptions should

-   be written legibly in ink or otherwise so as to be indelible

-   be written by the prescriber and not left for another person to

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

complete

-   be dated

-   state the full name and address of the patient

-   specify the age and weight of the patient (especially in the case of children)

-   be signed in ink by the prescriber

-   bear the contact details of the prescriber (e.g. name and telephone number)

When writing a prescription the following should be noted:

-   Name of medicines and preparations should be written in full. Unofficial abbreviations should not be used because there is a high risk of misinterpretation.

-   Non-proprietary (generic) names are given in the book and they should always be used in prescribing

-   Avoid the unnecessary use of decimal points, e.g. 3 mg, not 3.0 mg.

-   Quantities of 1 gram or more should be written 1 g.

-   Quantities less than 1 gram should be written in milligrams, e.g. 500 mg, and not 0.5 g.

-   Quantities less than 1mg should be written in micrograms, e.g. 100 microgram, not 0.1 mg.

-   Where decimals are unavoidable a zero should be written in front of the decimal point where there is no other figure, e.g. 0.5 ml, not

> .5ml.

-   'Micrograms' and 'nanograms' should NOT be abbreviated. Similarly, 'units' should NOT be abbreviated.

-   Use the term 'millilitre' (ml or mL) NOT cubic centimetre (cc, or cm3).

-   State dose and dose frequency. In the case of 'as required', a minimum dose interval should be specified, e.g. 'every 4-6 hrs as required for pain'.

-   State the quantity to be supplied or indicate the number of days of treatment required.

-   Write directions, preferably in English without abbreviation. It is recognised that some Latin abbreviations are used and these are detailed in the section on abbreviations. Do NOT use other abbreviations

-   Avoid combination drugs, unless there is a significant therapeutic advantage over single ingredient preparations (e.g. Co-trimoxazole).

-   Avoid the use of symptomatic treatments for minor self-limiting conditions.

-   Avoid, where possible, the prescribing of placebos. Spend some time educating and reassuring the patient.

-   Avoid multiple prescribing (polypharmacy), especially when the diagnosis is not clear.

-   Avoid the use of the parenteral route of administration except where

> **Introduction**

> there are clear, clinical indications for this route. Use the oral route whenever possible.

-   These figures relate to full term and not preterm infants. A reduced dosage may be required in preterm infants.

The development of an undesirable medical condition such as a new symptom, sign, laboratory or other test alteration, deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition, disability or death during or following administration of a medicinal product (allopathic or herbal) or use of a medical device, or the lack of effect of the product, is considered an adverse event that needs to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the product.

Spontaneous, voluntary reporting of adverse events relating to the use of prescription only medicines and vaccines, over-the-counter medicines and medical devices is now generally considered a norm in many countries for healthcare professionals and consumers alike. For health professionals, the need to report adverse reactions to these products is also a moral and professional obligation.

Although most medicines undergo rigorous safety monitoring during clinical trials before approval is given for their registration and use in any country, such trials have some limitations including the relatively small number of individuals involved. Post-marketing adverse drug event monitoring and reporting enables detection of less

commonly encountered, but potentially serious adverse events among a larger population. Older medicines and devices, with which healthcare practitioners may have experience with use, and newer ones with which they may not, can all give rise to adverse events in susceptible individuals. This edition of the Standard Treatment Guidelines, like the previous edition, includes copies of the Ghana Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) adverse reaction reporting form. Extra copies of the adverse reaction reporting form may be obtained from the FDA or through its Institutional Contact Persons at various health facilities throughout the country. Patients may also report directly through Patient Safety Centres in designated community pharmacies nationwide. Online submission of reports by both health professionals and patients can also be done through the SafetyWatch System at <http://adr.fdaghana.gov.gh/> or http:// fdaghana.gov.gh/adr/ or [www.fdaghana.gov.gh.](http://www.fdaghana.gov.gh/) An e-mail of a report may also be sent to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre at drug.safety@ fdaghana.gov.gh. A phone call to 0244 310 297 or to short code 4015

could be made for any assistance regarding drug safety issues.

Assigning causality to each reported event is carried out by a committee of experts from several disciplines in medicine and pharmacy and others representing the pharmaceutical industry and consumer interests, selected by the FDA. The process is anonymous and handled with the strictest confidence and is linked to a World Health Organization pharmacovigilance system.

The early identification of warning signals for a particular product from adverse event reporting and pharmacovigilance activities enables timely interventions to forestall any potential harm to the public.

# Chapter {#chapter .unnumbered}

Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of frequent, loose, watery stools 3 or more times a day. Diarrhoea may be accompanied by vomiting.

In children, the commonest cause is viral. There is therefore usually no need to prescribe antibiotics. Other diseases like malaria, pneumonia, ear infections and urinary tract infections, may be associated with diarrhoea. Fluid loss occurs quickly in this age group because of their size. If not corrected, it may result in dehydration, which can be fatal.

A complaint of diarrhoea should be taken seriously. Always ask about the frequency and the texture of the stools. Giving antibiotics in all cases of diarrhoea may worsen or prolong the condition except in special circumstances (See section on 'Causes' below). Enemas and laxatives should not be given to patients with diarrhoea.

## Causes {#causes .unnumbered}

> **Acute diarrhoea (\< 2 weeks)**

-   Infections

    -   Viral: e.g. rotavirus, norovirus

    -   Bacterial: e.g. Salmonella spp., Shigella, Campylobacter, *E. coli*, *Vibrio cholerae*

    -   Protozoal: e.g. *Entamoeba histolytica* (amoebiasis)

-   Drug-induced: e.g. penicillins

## Chronic diarrhoea (\> 2 weeks) {#chronic-diarrhoea-2-weeks .unnumbered}

-   Chronic infections: e.g. amoebiasis, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections with HIV

-   Functional: e.g. irritable bowel syndrome

-   Inflammatory: e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease

-   Malabsorption syndromes: e.g. chronic pancreatitis

-   Malignancy: e.g. colon cancer

-   Endocrine: e.g. hyperthyroidism, diabetic autonomic neuropathy

-   Drug-induced: e.g. laxatives, NSAIDs

## Symptoms {#symptoms .unnumbered}

-   Frequent watery stools

-   Blood or mucus in the stool

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Refer patients who fail to improve, or get worse, despite therapy for acute diarrhoea. Refer all patients with chronic diarrhoea to a specialist for further evaluation and management.

> **Treatment algorithm**
>
> **Fluid management for children with diarrhoea**
>
> **Treatment Plan A--Nodehydration**

-   Child can be treated safely at home

-   Instruct mother to give home-based fluids like rice water, koko, soup,

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017
>
> water, and Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS).

-   Breastfed babies should be given breast milk and ORS

-   Give as much as child wants of all the fluids

-   Child should continue to feed

-   Ask the mother to return to the health facility if the child gets worse, passes more watery stools, vomits repeatedly, becomes very thirsty, eats or drinks poorly or is not better in 2 days

-   Instruct mother on how to prevent diarrhoea

ORS currently recommended for use in mild to moderate diarrhoea has a reduced sodium and glucose concentration (low osmolarity).

## How to prepare ORS {#how-to-prepare-ors .unnumbered}

ORS: Dissolve the contents of one sachet of ORS in 600 ml or 1000 mls depending on type of ORS.

-   To get 600 ml, use 2 small (300 ml) soft drink bottles or 1 big beer bottle

-   To get 1000 ml, use 1L mineral water bottle

The child or adult should drink AS MUCH of it as he/she wants. If the child vomits, the mother should wait about 10 minutes and give it again.

## Treatment Plan B--mild tomoderate dehydration {#treatment-plan-bmild-tomoderate-dehydration .unnumbered}

> **For thechild withmild-moderate dehydration, usetreatment PlanB**

-   Child to be treated in the health facility

-   Give ORS over the first 4 hours as shown in the Table for Plan B

-   If child vomits, wait 10 minutes and start again

-   Continue with other fluids the child will accept

-   Instruct mother to continue breast feeding if child is breastfeeding

-   Observe stools passed and record quantity

-   Check for signs of worsening dehydration

-   If eyes become puffy, it means too much fluid has been given so stop ORS and re-evaluate

-   Reassess state of dehydration after 4 hours

-   If clinical state has improved with no dehydration - go to plan A

-   If there is still mild-moderate dehydration repeat plan B

-   If condition is worsening - go to plan C

## Treatment Plan C--Severe dehydration {#treatment-plan-csevere-dehydration .unnumbered}

-   A child with severe dehydration requires urgent treatment with IV fluids in hospital

-   If the child can drink, give ORS by mouth while the IV line is being

> set up

-   Start IV fluids immediately. Give 100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate solution or, if not available, normal saline or cholera replacement fluid (5:4:1), divided as shown in the Table for Plan C below:

-   If you cannot give the above treatment and cannot pass a nasogastric tube, refer to a health facility that can do so.

-   Reassess the child every 1-2 hours. If hydration status is not improving, give the IV fluid more rapidly than as stated in the Table for Plan B

-   Also give ORS (about 5 ml/kg body weight/hour) as soon as the child can drink: usually after 3-4 hours (infants) or 1--2 hours (children)

-   Reassess an infant after 6 hours and a child after 3 hours. Classify dehydration. Then choose the appropriate plan (A, B, or C) to continue treatment

-   Assess child hourly. If not improving or dehydration is worse, increase

> drip rate

-   Do not stop the IV fluids until the child has been observed to retain the ORS for at least 1 hour and there is improvement in the clinical condition

-   Continue ORS on treatment plan B and continue to observe child until child has no signs of dehydration, then move to Plan A

-   Severe diarrhoea may be complicated by marked fluid loss accompanied by loss of potassium (hypokalaemia) or on the other hand, impaired renal function leading to acidosis and elevated blood potassium (hyperkalaemia)

-   When the patient is passing adequate amounts of urine, probably indicating good renal function, start potassium containing foods such as coconut water and fresh fruits (e.g. banana)

-   If there is clinical and/or laboratory evidence of severe hypokalaemia, potassium should be given by the intravenous route using potassium chloride but only in a hospital. Potassium containing fluids such as

Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in young children. It accounts for more than a third of all hospitalizations of children less than 5 years. It occurs year round with peaks between the dry months (December - March). Children are infected by age 2 to 3 years and re-infections are common.

## Causes {#causes-1 .unnumbered}

-   Rotavirus: 5 types of rotavirus are known to cause \>90% of all cases worldwide

## Symptoms {#symptoms-1 .unnumbered}

-   Fever

-   Vomiting

-   Profuse watery diarrhoea

-   Thirst

## Signs {#signs .unnumbered}

-   Sunken eyes

-   Diminished skin turgor

-   Altered consciousness, depending on the degree of dehydration

## Investigations {#investigations-1 .unnumbered}

-   Detection of rotavirus antigen in stool by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA)

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-1 .unnumbered}

-   Correction of fluid and electrolyte deficits

> **Chapter 1:** Disorders of the Gastrointestinal Tract

-   Replacement of on-going fluid losses

-   Adequate nutrition to prevent malnutrition

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-1 .unnumbered}

-   Home-based fluids e.g. breast milk, porridges, coconut drink

-   Diarrhoea and vomiting continuing for \> 3 days

In general, constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or stools that are difficult to pass. There is great individual variation in normal bowel habits; therefore emphasis should be laid on changes in the bowel habit.

Diarrhoea alternating with constipation may indicate a large bowel cancer especially in those aged 40 years and above. In children and the elderly, this may indicate chronic constipation with spurious diarrhoea.

The habitual use of laxatives is very common in the community. This practice must be discouraged to avoid hypokalaemia and its consequences.

## Causes {#causes-2 .unnumbered}

> **Medical**

-   Diet deficient in roughage

-   Ignoring the urge to defaecate e.g. due to immobility

-   Hypothyroidism

-   Irritable bowel syndrome

-   Hypercalcaemia

-   Drugs e.g. atropine, codeine, morphine, tricyclic antidepressants,

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-2 .unnumbered}

The following categories of patients should be referred to a surgeon:

-   Patients with absent bowel sounds, vomiting or not passing flatus

-   Cases resistant to medical treatment

-   Any suspected surgical cause

Peptic ulcer may be duodenal or gastric. Duodenal ulcers are more common and occur more often in younger adults. Gastric ulcers usually occur after middle age. Gastric ulcers should be taken seriously because they may be malignant.

Peptic ulcers may lead to life threatening complications of bleeding, perforation and gastric outlet obstruction.

## Causes {#causes-3 .unnumbered}

-   *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*) infection

-   Excessive secretion of gastric acid

-   Inadequate protection of the lining of the stomach and duodenum against digestion by acid and pepsin

-   Medicines e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids

## Symptoms {#symptoms-3 .unnumbered}

-   Episodic abdominal pain (often aggravated by dietary indiscretions and lifestyle)

    -   May be a minor discomfort, gnawing, burning, dull ache or very

> severe pain

-   Typically pain is in the epigastrium or right hypochondrium

-   Occasionally high up behind the sternum or low down around the umbilicus

-   In duodenal ulcer, pain typically comes on when the patient is hungry and may wake the patient up in the middle of the night.

-   In gastric ulcer, it is typically worsened by food, and may be re- lieved by vomiting

-   Is relieved by alkalis and food in duodenal ulcer

<!-- -->

-   Vomiting may occur in both duodenal and gastric ulcers. It is usually a complication in duodenal ulcer (gastric outlet obstruction) but may be self-induced in gastric ulcer to relieve pain

## In children {#in-children .unnumbered}

-   Pain may be peri-umbilical

## Signs {#signs-2 .unnumbered}

-   There may be no abdominal signs

-   Weight loss (sometimes in gastric ulcer)

-   Weight gain (sometimes in duodenal ulcer)

-   Tenderness - epigastrium, right hypochondrium or umbilical region

> **Chapter 1:** Disorders of the Gastrointestinal Tract

## Investigations {#investigations-3 .unnumbered}

-   Haemoglobin

-   *H. pylori* stool antigen

-   Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (endoscopy)

-   Barium meal (in the absence of endoscopy)

-   Stool examination (to exclude intestinal parasites)

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-3 .unnumbered}

-   To relieve pain (dyspepsia) and reduce gastric acid secretion

-   To eradicate *H. pylori* if present

-   To promote healing of the ulcer

-   To prevent recurrence of the ulcer

-   To prevent and manage complications

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-3 .unnumbered}

-   Avoid alcohol and tobacco intake

-   Avoid foods that aggravate the pain

-   Allay anxiety and stress

-   Surgical treatment: for chronic cases with severe periodic attacks, failed medical treatment and complications e.g. perforation, gastric outlet obstruction and haemorrhage)

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-2 .unnumbered}

A.  **Dyspepsia**

or if surgery is indicated as stated above.

Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD) is caused by backflow of gastric and/or duodenal contents past the lower oesophageal sphincter into the oesophagus without belching or vomiting.

The disease is classified into two groups based on endoscopy findings as non-erosive gastro-oesophageal disease (non-erosive GORD) and erosive gastro-oesophageal disease (erosive GORD). Failure to treat may result in oesophagitis, ulceration, strictures and rarely adenocarcinoma.

## Causes {#causes-4 .unnumbered}

-   Obesity

-   Hiatus hernia

-   Increased intra-abdominal pressure e.g. in pregnancy

-   Long term use of nasogastric tube

-   Agents that decrease lower oesophageal sphincter pressure e.g. alcohol, cigarettes, anticholinergics (e.g. Hyoscine butylbromide, Propantheline bromide), other drugs -- Morphine, Diazepam, Pethidine and Calcium channel blockers

Refer to a specialist for confirmation of diagnosis and management.

Haemorrhoids or "piles" are enlarged, displaced anal cushions derived from engorged veins, which primarily presents with anal bleeding. First-degree haemorrhoids remain in the anal canal. Second-degree haemorrhoids prolapse, but reduce spontaneously, whereas third degree haemorrhoids prolapse and have to be replaced manually or remain

prolapsed permanently until surgically treated.

The history is very important. The nature of the bleeding, associated pain and other symptoms help differentiate haemorrhoids from other more sinister conditions. Always do a digital rectal examination to exclude carcinoma and other conditions when a patient complains of pain or bleeding from the anus. Altered or dark blood, or blood mixed with stools, should raise suspicion of bleeding higher up in the rectum or colon.

No treatment is required for haemorrhoids that are asymptomatic.

Avoid the use of purgatives.

# Chapter {#chapter-1 .unnumbered}

Amoebic liver abscess is a collection of typically brownish coloured fluid in the liver, occurring often as a single mass in the right lobe and a complication of intestinal infection with *Entamoeba histolytica*. Lung, heart and brain infections are uncommon sequelae. Occasionally, pyogenic abscesses may have a similar clinical presentation.

Treatment of amoebic abscesses should be initiated with a tissue agent active against the trophozoite form followed by a luminal agent to eliminate intra-luminal cysts.

Patients with abscesses that are large or not responding to treatment will need to be referred to a specialist.

Jaundice refers to yellow pigmentation of skin, palms and the sclerae as a result of elevated levels of bilirubin in blood. It may be visible when serum levels exceed 35 micromol/L in adults and 100 micromol/L in children. The symptoms and signs that accompany jaundice often provide helpful clues to the underlying cause.

In adults and children, hyperbilirubinaemia may result in hepatic encephalopathy [(See sections on 'Acute and Chronic Hepatitis' and 'Hepatic]{.underline} [Encephalopathy')]{.underline}. Jaundice in neonates can result in kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) because of the consequences of hyperbilirubinaemia on the brain of the newborn.

This refers to chronic inflammation of the liver of more than 6 months duration, with persistently elevated liver function tests. Chronic hepatitis can progress to liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Immunisation against Hepatitis B is now available for children under the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Adults in endemic areas including Ghana should be immunised against Hepatitis B infection after initial assessment of their immunological status regarding previous exposure to the virus.

Long-term monitoring for disease activity and hepatocellular carcinoma screening with six-monthly Hepatitis B viral DNA quantification, LFTs, abdominal ultrasound and alpha fetoprotein is mandatory for patients with chronic hepatitis B.

Patients with the following conditions must be referred to a specialist. Poor response to diuretic therapy or diuretic-refractory ascites, complicated cirrhotic ascites with suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepato-renal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Also refer when an underlying cause cannot be identified.

Vomiting can be induced by a variety of disease processes including gastrointestinal, neurologic, renal, psychiatric, cardiovascular, endocrine, pain and the effects of drugs. The best course of action in identifying the underlying cause is to carry out a detailed clinical evaluation and management plan, looking out for the aetiology, consequences and potential complications of vomiting.

Severe uncontrolled vomiting can result in significant dehydration and electrolyte imbalance accompanied by renal complications.

Anti-emetics should be prescribed only when the cause of vomiting is known as they may delay diagnosis.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver cell and must be differentiated from malignancies elsewhere that metastasize to the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs more commonly in men than in women and is often diagnosed several years after establishment of the initial causative condition. The disease has a poor prognosis resulting from metastatic or locally advanced disease. Complications include liver failure, variceal bleeding or tumour rupture with bleeding into the peritoneum. The tumour is often resistant to chemotherapy. Current strategies to prevent or treat hepatitis B and C infections and liver cirrhosis can potentially reduce the prevalence of HCC in the long term.

Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) can occur following the use of a variety of either prescription or over-the-counter medications. A high index of suspicion is often necessary in establishing the diagnosis. Early recognition of drug toxicity is important to permit withdrawal of the offending drug, assessment of severity and monitoring for acute liver failure. Drug-induced liver injury can be dose-dependent or idiosyncratic.

The hallmark for the treatment of DILI is early withdrawal of the offending drug.

# Chapter {#chapter-2 .unnumbered}

Malnutrition occurs when there is a deficiency in intake of essential nutrients (i.e. proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals). It is most commonly seen in children less than five years, particularly after weaning. Malnutrition reduces the individual's ability to fight disease and infection thereby increasing the likelihood of the patient presenting with diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, worm infestation, pneumonia, tuberculosis, otitis media, urinary tract infection etc. In adults, malnutrition frequently occurs in association with chronic alcoholism.

Protein energy malnutrition (PEM), when severe, presents in different forms such as marasmus, kwashiorkor or marasmic-kwashiokor. Birth-spacing, through family planning, as well as exclusive breast- feeding for up to 6 months, followed by Introduction of a weaning diet at 6 months and continuation with complimentary foods for up to 2 years, may be helpful measures in preventing malnutrition in young children. Encouraging a balanced diet for the family, including pregnant and lactating women, and nutrition education in schools and villages may help

reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in the community.

# Chapter {#chapter-3 .unnumbered}

Anaemia is defined as decreased concentration of haemoglobin for the age and sex of the individual (i.e. below 13 g/dL in adult males, 12 g/dL in adult females, 11 g/dL in children, and below 13.5 g/dL in the 1st week of life). Anaemia always has a cause, which must be identified and properly managed. The cause must be investigated before initiating treatment. In an emergency, blood samples must be taken for investigations before blood transfusion.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-18 .unnumbered}

Refer patients with haemoglobin levels that do not improve after two weeks on the above treatment or with severe anaemia from any cause, which recurs, to a specialist. Patients with suspected aplastic anaemia, anaemia due to uncontrolled bleeding, including heavy menstrual loss, would also require referral to a specialist.

Bleeding disorders may present at birth or develop later in life. The bleeding may be spontaneous or follow trauma or surgery and may be due to defective blood vessels, platelet disorders or clotting factor deficiency. Past episodes of excessive bleeding e.g. following circumcision, a family history of bleeding and drug therapy may be important clues to the diagnosis.

The pattern of bleeding is a helpful guide to its cause. In platelet and vessel wall defects, bleeding is usually into skin and mucosal surfaces like the gums, nose, gastrointestinal tract, whereas in coagulation factor deficiency (e.g. haemophilia), bleeding is into deep tissues like the brain, joints and muscles.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

In newborns with vitamin K deficiency (which leads to multiple coagulation factor deficiency) spontaneous bleeding occurs from various sites such as the umbilical cord, gastrointestinal tract, scalp and brain.

> **Chapter 4:** Haematological Disorders

This is an inherited disease characterized by the possession of two abnormal haemoglobins, at least one of which is haemoglobin S. There are various types, including HBSS, HBSC and HBS βthalassaemia. The possession of one normal haemoglobin (haemoglobin A) together with one abnormal haemoglobin (e.g. AS or AC) constitute a haemoglobinopathy trait and not sickle cell disease.

The use of the word ‹sickler› to describe patients with sickle cell disease must be avoided. Sickle cell disease patients may present either in the steady state, in crises or with complications. The crisis is commonly vaso-occlusive bone pain crisis. Other types of crises include acute chest syndrome, hyper-haemolytic crisis, aplastic crisis and sequestration crises. In vaso-occlusive crises there is occlusion of small vessels by sickled cells causing infarction and pain; in Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS), the patient presents with sudden onset of cough, difficulty in breathing and fever; in aplastic crises, infection with parvovirus causes sudden severe anaemia with a low reticulocyte count; in sequestration crises the spleen and liver enlarge rapidly due to trapping of red blood cells.

Patients with sickle cell disease should be encouraged to have periodic check-ups at a sickle cell clinic.

## Causes {#causes-18 .unnumbered}

-   Inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin genes from both parents, at least one of which is an S.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-20 .unnumbered}

Refer all sickle cell patients with bleeding into the eye, priapism, haematuria or renal disease and stroke to a specialist. The presence of osteomyelitis, aseptic necrosis of the hip, acute chest syndrome and persistent jaundice after initial management as recommended above should also warrant a referral to a specialist centre.

Patients with CNS events, unexplained high white cell and platelet counts (more than 15 and 500 x 109/L respectively), intractable morbid pain, repetitive crises or recurrent severe anaemia interfering with their lives should be referred to a specialist.

Plasma cell myeloma (previously referred to as multiple myeloma), is cancer affecting the plasma cells in the bone marrow. These abnormal plasma cells occur in increased numbers and produce abnormal non- functional immunoglobulins leading to impaired ability to fight infections in the patient affected, hyperviscosity and renal failure. In the bone marrow the increased plasma cells result in a reduction in normal blood cell production and erosion of bone with resultant peripheral blood cytopaenias, osteolytic lesions, pathological fractures and hypercalcaemia. The disease is commonest in the sixth decade and rare below the age of 40 years.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-21 .unnumbered}

All patients suspected to have plasma cell myeloma should be referred to a haematologist at a specialised tertiary centre for further evaluation and definitive management. Subsequent follow-up can be done by a physician specialist with guidance from the haematologist.

Leukaemia is cancer of the blood cells. There are two main types of leukaemia, which are lymphoid leukaemia and myeloid leukaemia. Each type of leukaemia can be classified as acute (where the patient falls suddenly ill) and chronic (where the patient may have been harbouring the disease for months without knowing). Thus in all, there are 4 main types of leukaemia: acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).

ALL is commonest in children especially boys, CLL is commonest in the elderly, AML and CML cut across all age groups and sexes.

The abnormal leukaemic cells especially in acute leukaemia, fill the marrow and prevent the marrow from producing the normal blood cells

i.e. red cells, white cells and platelets leading to anaemia, neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia, respectively.

This refers to a group of disorders characterized by malignant proliferation of lymphoid tissue usually presenting as lymph node swellings. There are 2 major histological types distinguished by the presence or absence of the Reed Sternberg (RS) cell. The 2 main groups are Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell present) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell absent). No age is exempt although generally the incidence of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) increases with age and immunosuppression while Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) shows a bimodal peak, in that there is a high incidence in the third and seventh decades.

Burkitt's lymphoma, a subtype of NHL, is one of the fastest growing

tumours known in man. There are three clinical variants - the endemic, sporadic and immunodeficiency associated forms. The endemic form is found in tropical and malaria endemic regions like Ghana and commonly presents as a jaw swelling with loosening of the associated teeth. In Ghana, it is the commonest childhood malignancy. It has a peak age incidence at 4-7 years with a male preponderance.

# Chapter {#chapter-4 .unnumbered}

Immunisation against vaccine preventable diseases through the national Expanded Programme for Immunisation (EPI) is one of the most effective measures of reducing morbidity, disability and mortality in the population, especially, in children.

Ghana currently has 12 (twelve) vaccines in the immunisation schedule, namely, BCG, oral poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, *haemophilus influenzae* type B, pneumococcus, rotavirus, measles, rubella and yellow fever. Newer vaccines may be introduced in the near future as they are discovered and found effective.

Immunisation is recommended for the following persons:

-   High risk groups (e.g. during a disease outbreak or by virtue of being exposed)

-   Young children

-   Elderly

-   The malnourished

The current schedule for routine Immunisation for children under 5 years is as follows:

Immunisation of preterm babies:

-   Consider all premature babies for full immunisation course.

-   Start immunisation in 2nd month after birth (after 4 weeks) irrespective of degree of prematurity. Give BCG on discharge.

-   Delay OPV in neonatal unit since there is a small chance of transfer of OPV virus to other babies. Hence give OPV on discharge from nursery

> \- not while still on admission.

Contraindications to Immunisation:

-   Current serious febrile illness: delay vaccine

-   History of severe reaction after previous dose (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) - avoid

-   Evolving neurological disease (e.g. uncontrolled epilepsy) - avoid whole cell pertussis vaccine

-   No DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib to child with convulsion/shock within 3 days of the most recent dose of DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib

-   No DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib to child with recurrent convulsions or active CNS disease

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

-   Yellow fever vaccine should not be given if there is history of anaphylaxis with ingestion of egg

-   Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection should not receive BCG and yellow fever vaccines since these are live vaccines. BCG vaccine can be given at birth since the HIV infected newborn is asymptomatic

Live vaccines should not be given to the following:

-   Pregnant women - for risk of teratogenic effect

-   Patients with malignant disease e.g. leukaemia, Hodgkins disease

-   Malignant disease of the reticuloendothelial system,

-   Patients with immune suppression, including Symptomatic HIV patients

-   Patients on chemotherapy (defer for 6 months after stopping chemotherapy treatment)

However:

-   Measles vaccine should be given to HIV positive patients even though it is a live vaccine because the benefit outweighs the risk

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-24 .unnumbered}

Refer all problems related to Immunisation to a paediatrician or EPI specialist.

Measles is an acute infectious disease, which usually occurs in children between 6 months and 3 years who have not been immunised, or completed the full immunisation schedule. It is prevented by 2 doses of measles vaccination at 9 and 18 months. The condition is very infectious from up to 7 days before, to 5 days after, appearance of the rash.

Complications include otitis media, with or without deafness, bronchopneumonia, croup, diarrhoea, vitamin A deficiency leading to xerophthalmia and blindness, malnutrition and activation of latent tuberculosis. Seriously ill measles patients requiring admission should be isolated. There is no specific treatment for measles. Antibiotics are not required, except for some specific complications.

Measles diagnosis is mainly clinical. The disease is now uncommon because of immunisation. However, high immunisation coverage needs to be maintained to keep the disease under control. Report all cases to the District Disease Control Officer for appropriate action.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-25 .unnumbered}

Refer patients with complications such as a black (haemorrhagic) rash, stridor, pneumonia, coma, great difficulty in eating or drinking, dehydration or malnutrition to the hospital.

This is a highly contagious bacterial respiratory tract infection common in children and adults. The incubation period is 7-21 days.

Complications include subconjunctival haemorrhage, otitis media, apnoea, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, activation of latent tuberculosis, dehydration, fever, convulsions, rectal prolapse, and malnutrition. Admit to hospital when complications are present.

Pertussis can be prevented by the "five-in-one" Immunisation recommended for all children (See section on 'Immunisation').

In the event of a child developing pertussis before immunisation, the "five in one" vaccine should still be given to protect against the four other diseases.

During epidemics, or when there is a clear history of contact in a child with catarrh, appropriate antibiotics may help reduce the period of infectivity and transmission. All cases should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer.

Tetanus is a disease caused by a bacterium, which produces a neurotoxin responsible for the clinical features. These bacteria live predominantly in the soil, so it is easy to get this infection whenever a break in the skin is not cleaned properly. Tetanus-prone wounds include burns, puncture injuries, or those contaminated by soil/manure, septic wounds, and those with much devitalised tissue and compound fractures. The use of non-sterilised instruments or dressings on the umbilical cord predisposes to neonatal tetanus. The incubation period is 3-21 days.

Tetanus should be treated as a medical emergency. Tetanus immunisation is the key for prevention (See section on 'Immunisation').

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-27 .unnumbered}

Refer patients to a specialist if spasms cannot be controlled.

Poliomyelitis is a viral disease, which is spread by faecal-oral or oral- to-oral transmission. Insanitary disposal of excreta and use of unsafe drinking water contribute to the spread. The disease is characterised by varying degrees of acute flaccid paralysis, which commonly persists.

Paralysis commonly affects one lower limb but any group of skeletal muscles, including the muscles of respiration and bulbar cells in the brain may be affected.

Poliomyelitis is commonly acquired in childhood. The infection is often sub-clinical and may only appear as a mild flu-like illness. Only few cases progress to develop paralysis. However, injections during periods of the febrile illness are associated with an increased incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis.

Poliomyelitis is preventable by Immunisation. Prevention is almost certain if 4 doses of oral polio vaccine are given as in the EPI schedule. Rarely Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis (VAPP) may occur in recipients of oral polio vaccines and their unimmunised contacts. This is usually associated with polio virus type 2.

The bacteria responsible for this disease produces a toxin that damages human body tissues and organs. It commonly affects the tonsils and sometimes the skin causing ulcers. It is spread mainly by respiratory droplets from person to person, and less commonly through skin contact. Infected patients may recover after initial symptoms and signs or develop severe weakness and die within 6-10 days. Complications may develop in the early phase of the disease or weeks later such as abnormal heartbeat and heart failure, damage to valves of the heart, or respiratory

obstruction leading to death.

> **Chapter 5:** Immunisable Diseases

The disease is now uncommon because of immunisation. However, high immunisation coverage needs to be maintained to keep the disease under control because it has a high mortality rate.

Pneumococcal disease presents more commonly as non-invasive disease in the form of non-bacteraemic pneumonia, middle-ear infections, sinusitis, or bronchitis. However, it may also manifest as Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases (IPD) in the form of pneumonia with empyema and/or bacteraemia or meningitis as a result of haematogenic spread. In developing countries, non-bacteraemic pneumonia causes the majority of pneumococcal deaths. Ninety distinct serotypes have been identified.

Pneumococcal disease is effectively prevented with Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) at 6,10 and 14 weeks for infants. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for persons older than 2 years with underlying medical conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease. Adults with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants should receive PCV13 followed by PPSV23.

Neonatal hypoglycaemia refers to a random blood glucose level below 2.6 mmol/L in the newborn.

As the clinical signs may be variable, or indeed absent, for small or sick babies or infants of diabetic mothers the random blood glucose level should be checked every three hours for the first 24 hours until it stays above 3.5 mmol/L for a further 24 hours.

Neonatal hypoglycaemia may result in death if not promptly treated and should therefore be managed as soon as suspected. Successful treatment results in prompt response. To prevent hypoglycaemia, breastfeeding should be encouraged soon after birth. If the neonate is unable to suck, a nasogastric tube may be passed and expressed breast milk given. If enteral feeds are contraindicated, intravenous fluids should be started immediately.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-34 .unnumbered}

Refer to a specialist if patient does not respond promptly in spite of adequate treatment.

Jaundice in the neonate may be visible when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 100 micromol/L. Neonatal jaundice is important because of the consequences of hyperbilirubinaema on the brain of the newborn. This condition is called kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) and may cause death. Infants who survive may be handicapped with cerebral palsy, and associated deafness, mental retardation and motor incoordination.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Approximately 80% of newborns will be jaundiced in the first week of life and most of this is physiological. This occurs on day 3 and lasts up to 10 days. This jaundice is mild and the baby remains healthy.

Jaundice in the neonate is likely to be pathological if it is present within the first day of life; or conjugated (direct) bilirubin is more than 40 micromol/L; or total bilirubin is more than 170 micromol/L in preterm and more than 260 micromol/L in the term infant; or the neonate is significantly jaundiced beyond 14 days or has jaundice with fever.

Exchange transfusion is the definitive treatment for hyperbilirubinaemia that has reached the level where kernicterus may occur.

Retinoblastoma is a congenital malignant tumour originating from the retina of the eye. This tumour may be hereditary, particularly the bilateral form which forms about 30% of cases. Most tumours however are sporadic (spontaneous mutation). This is the third commonest cancer seen amongst children in Ghana. Most children present before five years of age. It rarely occurs in older children. The prognosis with early presentation is excellent with a 95% chance of long term cure. There is a high rate of development of tumours of other organs later in life in the hereditary form.

Wilms tumour (nephroblastoma) is a malignant embryonal tumour of renal tissue. It is the fourth commonest cancer amongst children in Ghana. About 80% of children with Wilms tumour present before 5 years of age. It can present soon after delivery. It may be associated with congenital anomalies such as hemihypertrophy and the absence of the iris (aniridia). Wilms tumour has a very good prognosis with an over 80% chance of long-term cure.

Persistent unexplained chest pain.

Ischaemic heart disease is a condition whereby there is reduced blood supply to the heart muscle. It comprises of stable angina pectoris and the acute coronary syndromes.

> **[STABLE ANGINA PECTORIS]{.underline}**

Stable angina pectoris is pain or discomfort that occurs in the front of the chest, and may radiate to the neck, shoulders, jaw or arms. The chest pain is typically induced by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or glyceryl trinitrate. Individuals who experience stable angina pectoris are at a high risk of developing acute coronary syndromes or a heart attack. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cigarette smoking, plasma lipid abnormalities, obesity, family history of heart disease and persistently elevated markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein.

Risk factors for this condition include obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidaemia.

![](media/image1.jpeg)

> **[ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME]{.underline}**

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a term that describes symptoms resulting from severe acute myocardial ischaemia. The ischaemia may, or may not, lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack). ACS is classified

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

as ST segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction - STEMI) or a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (an ACS without elevation of cardiac enzymes). The risk factors for ACS are identical to those for, and include previous episodes of, stable angina pectoris.

Risk factors for this condition include obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking and hyperlipidaemia.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-42 .unnumbered}

All patients with suspected ACS require an urgent ECG. If ECG is not available or cannot be interpreted, refer immediately to a higher facility.

Patients with confirmed STEMI in any facility should be referred urgently to a Physician Specialist or Cardiologist for reperfusion therapy (after an initial oral dose of 300 mg of aspirin).

Other patients with N-STEMI and unstable angina should be referred to a physician specialist or cardiologist after the initial management above.

Dyspnoea is an uncomfortable awareness of one's own breathing. It is often the main symptom of cardiopulmonary disease although the differential diagnosis extends beyond these two systems. Dyspnoea of sudden onset should be treated as a medical emergency.

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease although often asymptomatic. The deep veins of the lower limbs are affected most commonly, but thrombosis may affect other sites, including the upper limbs, intracranial and splanchnic veins. Complications include pulmonary thromboembolism, which can be life-threatening. It is therefore essential to have a reliable method for establishing the DVT risk of patients and to take active steps to provide prophylactic treatment as necessary. Common risk factors for DVT include obesity, smoking, prolonged immobility (e.g. bed rest, long haul flights), major surgery e.g. orthopaedic, abdominal and pelvic surgery, pregnancy and the puerperium, after caesarean section, malignancies, inherited blood disorders, oestrogen therapy and medical conditions, e.g. congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, nephrotic syndrome, stroke, systemic lupus erythematosus.

In cases of confirmed DVT, treatment with anticoagulants must not be delayed unnecessarily unless there are significant contraindications to their use such as recent intracerebral bleed, severe liver disease, active peptic ulcer, bleeding disorders, and severe hypertension.

## Causes {#causes-38 .unnumbered}

-   Stagnation of blood in the vein

-   Increased viscosity of blood

-   Inflammation of the blood vessel causing damage

## Symptoms {#symptoms-42 .unnumbered}

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

-   Swelling or firmness of affected limb (usually unilateral)

-   Pain in the affected limb

-   Mild fever

## Signs {#signs-41 .unnumbered}

-   Swelling of affected limb

-   Differential warmth

-   Tenderness

-   Redness

-   Pitting oedema

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-44 .unnumbered}

Refer to physician specialist for management and monitoring.

Pulmonary Embolism (PE) results from thrombi, often from the deep veins of the lower limbs or pelvis, which are transported via the right heart into the pulmonary vasculature. Large emboli may cause obstruction to blood flow and result in life-threatening hypoxia and high mortality. PE should therefore be managed as a medical emergency.

The risk factors and management for PE are similar to those for DVT. (See section on 'DVT').

## Causes {#causes-39 .unnumbered}

## Symptoms {#symptoms-43 .unnumbered}

-   Dyspnoea

-   Pleuritic pain

-   Cough

-   Haemoptysis (due to pulmonary infarction)

-   Presyncope, syncope or collapse (massive PE)

-   Unilateral swelling of a limb

## Signs {#signs-42 .unnumbered}

-   Tachypnoea

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-45 .unnumbered}

Refer all patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, where facilities are unavailable for confirmation, to a physician specialist or cardiologist for expert management after stabilisation.

A stroke can be defined as a sudden global or focal neurological deficit resulting from spontaneous haemorrhage or infarction of the central nervous system, with objective evidence of an infarction or haemorrhage, irrespective of the duration of clinical symptoms. A CT or MRI scan is required to make the diagnosis and exclude other intracranial lesions that could present similarly.

A Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), on the other hand, is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia. There is no objective evidence of acute infarction in the affected region of brain or retina.

In adults, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, atrial fibrillation and smoking, increase the risk for strokes. In children sickle cell disease and cyanotic heart disease are important risk factors for strokes.

Patients should ideally have multidisciplinary care.

## Causes {#causes-40 .unnumbered}

This is a condition in which the heart is unable to produce adequate cardiac output, and in so doing, is unable to meet the body's metabolic requirements. The cardiac dysfunction may predominantly involve the left or the right ventricle individually or both ventricles simultaneously. This later case is termed Biventricular Failure (BVF) or Congestive Cardiac Failure (CCF).

The functional classification of heart failure using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification is described in the table below.

Congenital malformation of the heart, commonly referred to as "Hole-in-Heart", is quite a common malformation with an incidence of 8 out of 1000 live births. There are two main groups of congenital heart disease namely, acyanotic and cyanotic. The acyanotic types include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus as well as aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis and coarctation of the aorta. The cyanotic types are associated with a mixing of deoxygenated blood with oxygenated blood and include Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA).

Early recognition of the specific type and appropriate medical or surgical intervention is important in improving the quality of life and reducing morbidity from complications.

> **Chapter 7:** Disorders of the Cardiovascular System

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-47 .unnumbered}

Refer all children with congenital heart disease to a paediatric cardiologist or paediatrician for further clinical assessment and management.

This is a life threatening paediatric cardiac emergency.

It usually occurs in infants with a peak incidence between 4 and 6 months. A severe episode may lead to limpness, seizures, cerebrovascular accident or even death. Spells may be brief (1-2 minutes) and self-correct or may progress to a severe, life-threatening episode. Prompt recognition by parents and medical staff is important. The attack is often early in the morning with no apparent reason. It may be precipitated following a bath, by prolonged crying, defaecation, dehydration, febrile illness or induction of anaesthesia.

## Causes {#causes-43 .unnumbered}

-   Congenital heart disease e.g. Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary stenosis, double outlet right ventricle, tricuspid atresia, Eisenmenger syndrome

## Symptoms {#symptoms-46 .unnumbered}

Hypertension or 'high blood pressure' carries an increased risk of early death from stroke, heart attack, heart failure and kidney failure if it is not detected early and properly controlled. Owing to this, the focus must

> **Chapter 7:** Disorders of the Cardiovascular System

be on when to initiate treatment, rather than how hypertension should be defined.

Since there are often no specific symptoms associated with hypertension, there is the need for regular blood pressure (BP) screening in the adult population for early detection.

In the general adult population, treatment must be initiated at a BP of 140/90 mmHg or higher for individuals below 60 years of age, and 150/90 mmHg or higher in those above 60 years. For individuals with diabetes mellitus or non-diabetics with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), treatment for hypertension must be initiated at a BP of 140/90 mmHg, irrespective of age.

In the majority of patients with hypertension, no specific underlying cause is identified (primary hypertension). In these individuals, increasing age, family history, excess body weight, lack of physical activity and excessive alcohol intake may be possible predisposing factors. In about 10% of cases of hypertension, there may be an underlying kidney disease, endocrine disorder, renal artery stenosis or coarctation of the aorta (secondary hypertension).

Once a diagnosis of hypertension is made, the individual should be evaluated to exclude secondary causes and to identify other existing cardiovascular risk factors e.g. diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, etc.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Hypertension in children is defined as an average systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure that is ≥ 95th percentile for gender, age, and height on 3 or more separate occasions taken in the right arm (in view of possibility of coarctation of aorta). An appropriate cuff size that covers two thirds (⅔) of the length of the arm (between shoulder and elbow) and encircling the whole arm, should be used.

In general, a blood pressure of \> 110/70 mmHg in children aged 2-5 years and \> 115/76 mmHg in those aged 6-12 years and more than 128/82 mmHg in adolescents is considered abnormal and would require a referral to, and evaluation by a paediatrician.

Most adolescent and childhood hypertension, especially in infants and younger children, is due to secondary causes (See section on 'Hypertension in Adults'). Adolescents, however, may have early onset primary hypertension.

## Causes {#causes-46 .unnumbered}

(See section on 'Hypertension in Pregnancy' under 'Obstetric care and Obstetric Disorders')

A hypertensive crisis is a severe and potentially life threatening increase in blood pressures (BP) which may result in an acute stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, seizures (hypertensive encephalopathy), heart attack, acute dissection of aorta, heart failure, renal damage or eclampsia (during pregnancy). The underlying cause may be primary hypertension; however, secondary causes of hypertension must be excluded.

In adult patients this often occurs with a BP \> 180/120 mmHg, while in children this may occur at lower BP levels.

> **Chapter 7:** Disorders of the Cardiovascular System

These patients need careful examination to exclude target organ damage. Rapid correction of blood pressure with careful monitoring to avoid a precipitous drop is indicated to prevent organ damage.

Arrhythmias are disorders of cardiac rate, rhythm and conduction. They can be classified as bradyarrhythmias (heart rate \< 60 per minute) and tachyarrhythmias (heart rate \> 100 per minute).

Bradyarrhythmias include sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses and atrioventricular blocks. The tachyarrhythmias can further be classified into supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, based on their site of origin. Tachyarrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.

> **Chapter 7:** Disorders of the Cardiovascular System

Prior to drug treatment of a suspected cardiac arrhythmia, a 12-lead ECG must be done to confirm the rhythm abnormality. It is dangerous to use an antiarrhythmic drug without doing an ECG. Refer symptomatic patients to hospital immediately. The choice of drug treatment depends on the type of arrhythmia and severity of symptoms.

Acute rheumatic fever is an illness caused by an immunological reaction to group A streptococcal infection of the throat. The onset of symptoms occurs 1-3 weeks after an untreated or inadequately treated throat infection. The disease occurs mainly in children and adolescents with a peak age of 5-15 years. Acute rheumatic fever often results in lasting damage to heart valves leading to the chronic form, which is known as rheumatic heart disease.

Individuals who have had acute rheumatic fever previously are more likely to have subsequent episodes. These recurrences may cause further heart valve damage. Following treatment of an acute episode, secondary prophylaxis should be continued for a minimum of 10 years after the recent episode of acute rheumatic fever or until age 21 years (whichever is longer). For those with severe rheumatic heart disease secondary prophylaxis should be continued indefinitely.

Rheumatic heart disease is an important cause of heart failure and premature death. In Ghana, acute rheumatic fever may mimic malaria, typhoid fever and other febrile conditions, while the joint symptoms may mimic sickle cell disease.

Jones criteria is used for diagnosis of rheumatic fever.

Dizziness is a nonspecific term that refers to abnormal sensation of body orientation or position in space. These include feeling of unsteadiness, light-headedness and vertigo. Patients often find these

> **Chapter 7:** Disorders of the Cardiovascular System

sensations difficult to describe. Dizziness is almost always associated with other symptoms, therefore a careful history and focused physical examination should be performed in all cases to identify the cause.

Like dizziness, "blackouts" is a vague, descriptive term implying either altered consciousness, visual disturbance or a sensation of falling. A careful history, particularly from an eye-witness, is essential.

Episodes of transient disturbance of consciousness and falls are common clinical problems. It is usually possible to distinguish between a fit (a seizure), an episode of fainting and other types of attack from the history given by the patient and the account of an eye witness.

This is a self-limiting infection of the upper respiratory tract, particularly the nasopharyngeal mucosa and sinuses. It is contagious and spread by airborne droplets, as well as from hands and contact with contaminated surfaces. The symptoms resolve without antibiotic treatment, usually within a week.

If the 'cold' lasts longer than a week and there is persistent fever and cough, a diagnosis of influenza may be considered. With influenza, fever, systemic symptoms and prostration are more pronounced. Secondary bacterial infection may be associated with purulent phlegm or offensive nasal discharge and fever.

Occasionally, the common cold is complicated by otitis media and pharyngotonsillitis, particularly in children, in which case one should refer to the appropriate sections for treatment.

Pneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue caused by various bacteria, viruses or fungi. Identification of the causative organism and drug sensitivity testing is the key to correct treatment. However, because of the serious nature of the infection, antibiotic treatment should be started immediately based on knowledge of the most probable causative organism and the antibiotics used for its treatment. Local knowledge of drug resistance patterns are also taken into account. Treatment may be maintained or changed based on culture results and assessment of the patient's response to initial treatment. In the event that the cultures of blood or sputum prove negative, empiric treatment is continued with clinical response as a guide.

The severity of the illness is a key factor in the decision for admission, and the choice of first or second-line treatment.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-57 .unnumbered}

Refer to the paediatrician or physician specialist if no improvement occurs (i.e. fever remains high, patient is still breathless, or repeat X-rays show complications or no resolution).

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bronchial airways, which manifests as recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath, which is usually reversible with treatment. It is characterised by increased sensitivity to many environmental agents. Asthma is variable and may be associated with seasons like the rainy season or harmattan. Bronchial asthma occurs at all ages but peaks in childhood. It is classified as an allergic disease, and may be associated with a personal or family history of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), eczema or allergic conjunctivitis.

Complications of asthma include pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumonia.

## Causes {#causes-52 .unnumbered}

-   Allergens e.g. house dust mite, cockroach droppings, grass, pollen and animal hair

-   Environmental factors e.g. air pollution, climatic changes, strong scents and smoke (including cigarette smoke and car fumes)

-   Viral infections

-   Exercise

-   Emotions and hyperventilation

-   Drugs e.g. aspirin, NSAIDS and beta-blockers such as propranolol

-   Occupational exposure to industrial chemicals, dust and drug manufacturing

## Symptoms {#symptoms-56 .unnumbered}

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-58 .unnumbered}

In acute exacerbation, refer patients if not improving or rapidly deteriorating after initial management to a specialist.

All discharged clients should be followed up within one week and referred to a specialist clinic for continued care.

For chronic asthma refer patients with persistent symptoms to a specialist clinic in a regional or tertiary hospital, and patients who have recurrent acute exacerbations within a few days/ weeks of each other for specialist care and review of their treatment.

Also refer when a patient requires more than one course of oral prednisolone in 3 months.

This refers to an acute inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. It is often found in association with upper respiratory tract infection. Most cases do not require antibiotics, however, they may be prescribed if the patient's SPO2 is less than 92% or if there is an underlying co-morbidity like malnutrition, measles, rickets, anaemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis or HIV/AIDS.

## Causes {#causes-53 .unnumbered}

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-59 .unnumbered}

Refer all complicated cases of acute bronchitis to a specialist.

This is chronic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa due to irritants such as tobacco smoke. It occurs after the age of 40 years and is part of the syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is progressive worsening with age, eventually resulting in chronic respiratory failure. It is aggravated by recurrent viral and bacterial infections.

Oxygen therapy in these patients must be given with caution to prevent carbon dioxide retention due to depression of respiration. High flow rates remove the central hypoxic drive that maintains respiratory effort and can be harmful.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-60 .unnumbered}

Refer all patients not improving on initial management, with acute exacerbation, recurrent infective exacerbations or rapidly deteriorating to a specialist.

In bronchiectasis, the medium and smaller sized bronchi and bronchioles are damaged. Their ciliated epithelium is destroyed by inflammation and scarring, which in a vicious cycle of infection and further scarring leads to permanent dilatation and bronchial wall thickening. The mucus lining of these airways become colonized by bacteria and generate copious amounts of purulent and often offensive sputum. The disease, if not treated is characterized by frequent infective exacerbations with progressively worsening lung function.

## Causes {#causes-55 .unnumbered}

-   Childhood pneumonia e.g. whooping cough, post measles

-   Post-pulmonary tuberculosis

-   Chronic rhinosinusitis with post-nasal drip

-   Asthma and COPD

-   Fibrosing lung disease of any cause e.g. rheumatoid lung disease

-   Immune deficiency states e.g. HIV infection, agammaglobulinaemia

-   Inherited disorders e.g. cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia should be considered in young children presenting with bronchiectasis

## Symptoms {#symptoms-59 .unnumbered}

A seizure is a clinical event caused by a transient disturbance of brain function due to an abnormal paroxysmal neuronal discharge in the brain. If these episodes are recurrent without an identifiable cause, they are commonly described as epilepsy. The term status epilepticus is used for repeated seizures, which occur without the patient regaining consciousness between attacks. (See section on 'Epilepsy and Status epilepticus').

The clinical presentation depends on the part of the brain affected. Patients may sometimes describe the warning signals (termed a prodrome or aura), which they experienced before the event. A detailed description by a witness is key.

General anaesthesia and ventilation may be required in severe cases and where high doses of anticonvulsants are required.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-64 .unnumbered}

If seizures remain uncontrolled within 30 minutes after they began, refer immediately for specialist attention. Note that oxygenation should be continued during transfer.

Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures or the tendency to have seizures. Epilepsy is now classified as Generalized (tonic, clonic, absence, atonic or myoclonic) with aura and loss of consciousness or Focal.

Traditionally, a single seizure has been regarded as an indication for investigation and assessment, but not for drug treatment unless the circumstances of the seizure necessitate it.

Drug treatment should certainly be considered after two seizures, or if the second seizure follows closely from the first. The type of drug used depends on the type of seizure.

Drug treatment of epilepsy should be guided by the following general principles. Begin with a single drug at the lowest dosage range and increase dose gradually to the upper limit of dosage range or until side-effects appear, if seizures are not controlled.

Subsequently, if seizures still remain uncontrolled, change to a different drug by gradually reducing the dose of the initial agent while simultaneously introducing the new one. This usually takes 3-4 weeks.

Try three separate drugs in this fashion if no clinical response is observed, before resorting to drug combinations.

Anticonvulsant drug treatment can be totally withdrawn (gradually) in a patient with epilepsy only after a 2-year seizure-free period and after a full evaluation and discussion with the patient.

Patients with epilepsy should be advised not to drive a vehicle if not certified to be seizure-free, swim alone, work at heights, operate machines, cook by open fire alone, nor ingest alcohol excessively.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-65 .unnumbered}

Refer all patients with intractable seizures to the specialist

Unconsciousness is a common clinical problem and may be associated with diseases of several organs in the body. The cause of unconsciousness is often not immediately evident, and a systematic approach to its diagnosis and management is therefore important. Obtaining a thorough history from accompanying relatives, friends and the police is essential.

## Causes {#causes-59 .unnumbered}

-   Infections e.g. meningitis, cerebral malaria

-   Hypoglycaemia (diabetes-related or alcohol induced)

-   Diabetic ketoacidosis

-   Severe hypertension with encephalopathy

-   Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) or stroke

-   Drug ingestion or overdose e.g. alcohol, salicylates, barbiturates,

> cocaine

-   Electrolyte imbalance

-   Epilepsy - status epilepticus

-   Head injury

-   Major organ failure e.g. hepatic failure, renal failure and myocardial infarction

-   Hypoxia from severe anaemia

-   Poisoning e.g. kerosene, pesticides, herbicides

## Symptoms {#symptoms-64 .unnumbered}

-   Depends on the underlying cause (See appropriate sections)

## Signs {#signs-64 .unnumbered}

-   Depends on the underlying cause (See appropriate sections)

## Investigations {#investigations-64 .unnumbered}

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-66 .unnumbered}

Refer to a specialist for further definitive management if not responding to standard measures of resuscitation.

# Chapter {#chapter-9 .unnumbered}

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is the most common neurobehavioural disorder affecting children. It may present in infancy and can continue into adulthood. It affects 5-8% of children and nearly three times as many boys as girls. Nearly half the children presenting with ADHD may also have an associated learning problem.

The term is commonly applied wrongly to the normal child who is always on the go and never sits still. Recognized causes of hyperactivity in children include normal variation, boredom or understimulation or excessive restraint, learning difficulties, autism, partial seizures and drugs like clonazepam, phenobarbitone and phenytoin.

ADHD is also wrongly attributed to poor parenting, too much TV, poor schools, poor home environment, excess sugar or food allergies.

No specific tests confirm a diagnosis of ADHD. A full physical and neurological examination must be done in all cases. The behavioural deficits and excesses that constitute a diagnosis of ADHD must be present in multiple settings such as home and school.

The symptoms may be precipitated by stress and the signs are often variable and may include resistance to eye opening upon examination. The diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion since it is often difficult to separate from epileptic seizures and may, in fact co-exist with epilepsy.

## Symptoms {#symptoms-67 .unnumbered}

-   Recurrent tonic clonic-like seizures

-   Attacks usually occur only when attention of other people can be attracted

-   Patients hardly ever get injured, even when they fall (unlike in true seizures)

-   Thrusting pelvic movements are common during "seizure" attacks

-   Tongue biting, if it occurs is usually at the tip of the tongue instead of the sides as in true seizures

-   May have urinary incontinence as in normal seizures

## Investigations {#investigations-67 .unnumbered}

-   Serum prolactin

-   EEG

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-50 .unnumbered}

-   To stop seizures

-   To restore normalcy

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-67 .unnumbered}

-   Reassure parents, guardians etc.

-   Counselling

-   Psychotherapy

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-63 .unnumbered}

-   Anti-epileptic medicines do not appear to have any beneficial effect on frequency of attacks

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-69 .unnumbered}

Refer all cases for evaluation by psychologist or psychiatrist.

Insomnia is defined as a subjective report of difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep, and that results in some form of daytime impairment. Insomnia symptoms occur quite commonly in the general population. Risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, co-morbid disorders such as medical, psychiatric, substance use, and shift work. Patients with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders have relatively high rates of insomnia.

## Causes {#causes-62 .unnumbered}

-   Behavioural - spending more time in bed in an effort to "catch up"

> on sleep

-   Stress

-   Learned habits which do not enhance sleep

-   Cognitive distortions (e.g. if one does not sleep throughout the night, one has not slept at all)

-   Medicines (e.g.for treatment of common cold, hypertension, asthma)

-   Caffeine-containing beverages (e.g. coffee, tea)

-   Withdrawal from alcohol and other drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines)

-   Medical condition (e.g. sleep apnea, airway obstruction, liver disease, renal disease, thyroid disorders)

-   Psychological and environmental factors

-   Other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and mood disorders

-   Travel (especially across time zones leading to jet lag)

-   Shift work

## Symptoms {#symptoms-68 .unnumbered}

-   Prolonged average time for falling asleep - longer than 30 minutes

-   Total sleep time less than 6.5 hours

-   Difficulty falling asleep

-   Frequent awakenings

-   Difficulty returning to sleep

-   Awakening too early in the morning

-   Sleep that does not feel restful, refreshing or restorative

-   Anticipating poor sleep hours before bedtime, and becoming more alert and anxious as bedtime approaches

-   Daytime effects of poor sleep:

    -   Fatigue and sleepiness

    -   Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties

    -   Poor quality of life (worsened by interpersonal difficulties, or

Refer to clinical psychologist for those patients who do not respond to the common non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for cognitive behaviour therapy. Refer patients with underlying physical causes to the appropriate specialists.

Depression is a mood disorder, which may occur in all age groups, although the symptoms may differ in children. It is a relatively common condition and has a tendency to recur. Some affected persons may turn out to have bipolar disorder, in which case, episodes of mania occur.

Clinically significant depression, also called major depression, is

> **Chapter 10:** Psychiatric Disorders

twice as common in women as in men. Many affected individuals seek help from spiritual and traditional healers. For a good proportion of those who go to hospitals, their condition is not recognised.

Depression is a significant cause of morbidity all over the world and most people who attempt or successfully complete suicide have depression. One should not dismiss or take for granted statements made by patients such as "I want to die", "life is not worth living", or "I am fed up with life". All cases of attempted suicide should be referred to a psychiatrist after initial management of the presenting complication e.g. self-inflicted injuries or poisoning.

Recurrent depression or unipolar depression is treated differently (with antidepressants) from bipolar depression, which responds more to mood stabilizers.

The diagnostic criteria for major depression relies on the presence of at least five (5) of the symptoms listed in the section on symptoms below, experienced every day for at least two weeks.

In the treatment of depression, maximum tolerable doses of antidepressant medications must be given for at least 6 weeks before deciding a particular medication is not effective.

After an episode of depression, treatment must be continued for at least 6 months, as there is a high risk of relapse within this period.

Antidepressants must be stopped immediately if a manic swing occurs. Patients with suicidal tendencies must be admitted and kept under close observation.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-71 .unnumbered}

Refer patients with atypical or unusual symptoms, hysterical or phobic features, and those who do not respond to adequate anti-depressant treatment within 2 months, to a psychiatrist, as should children suspected to suffer from depression.

Patients requiring Cognitive Behaviour Therapy should be referred

to a psychologist.

Schizophrenia is probably the most severe and potentially disabling form of mental illness in every community worldwide. It may present as an acute or chronic illness. The clinical features include characteristic 'positive' or 'negative' symptoms, deterioration in social, work or interpersonal relationships and continued evidence of disturbed behaviour for at least 6 months.

The clinical features may be numerous and can change over time. Psychosis associated with substance abuse and mood disorders with psychotic features may mimic schizophrenia.

For this illness, a few people may recover completely after an episode or two. Treatment must be started once symptoms are present. A definitive diagnosis and establishment of a treatment plan is best carried out by a psychiatrist. Treatment for acute episodes can be started by a psychiatrist and follow up treatment continued by most health care givers. Treatment must be for at least 18 months after remission of symptoms for a first episode. However, life long treatment is probably the best strategy to avoid recurrence.

Side effects such as extra-pyramidal reactions (slowness, drooling, stiffness, tremors, rigidity, muscle spasms including tongue sticking

> **Chapter 10:** Psychiatric Disorders

out, neck bending, etc.) to antipsychotics may occur especially when administered at high doses. These adverse reactions can be prevented or managed with anticholinergic agents, which must be used sparingly as they may contribute to the development of another adverse event, called tardive dyskinesia, in the long term. (See section on 'Adjunct Treatment' below)

## Causes {#causes-64 .unnumbered}

-   Largely unknown

-   Possible associations:

    -   Bio-Genetic (to do with dopamine and serotonin receptors)

    -   Bio-Psycho social determinants; genetic predisposition coupled with stress (economic, disruptive family environments, etc.) Birth defects in brain associated with season of birth, possible viral infections, etc.

    -   Environmental triggers

    -   Illicit drugs (marijuana, amphetamines etc.)

## Symptoms/Signs 'Positive' symptoms {#symptomssigns-positive-symptoms .unnumbered}

-   Hallucinations (e.g. hearing voices)

-   Delusions (stated beliefs which cannot be substantiated)

-   Incoherent speech or illogicality

-   Odd or disorganised behaviour

-   Patient believes his or her thoughts are controlled by outside forces

## 'Negative' symptoms {#negative-symptoms .unnumbered}

-   Poverty of speech or content of speech (few words or with little substance)

-   Apathy

-   Reduced social contact or withdrawal

-   Flattened affect (showing little facial expressive responses)

-   Delusions

    -   May be persecutory, such as undue suspicion, or totally bizarre, like being controlled or being made to feel emotions or sensa- tions

    -   Grandiose delusions may also occur but without the elevated mood seen in manic patients

-   Hallucinations

    -   commonly auditory (but may involve any of the other senses)

    -   Auditory hallucinations of multiple voices commenting on pa- tients' actions, arguing about the patient are almost diagnostic

-   Motor disorders like posturing, excitement or stupor may occur but are not essential for diagnosis

## Investigations {#investigations-70 .unnumbered}

-   Usually none required for diagnosis

-   Tests to rule out organic causes of psychosis

-   Baseline full blood count, blood sugar, lipids, liver and kidney function

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017
>
> tests, for purposes of guiding treatment

-   For Olanzapine and Risperidone, ensure that fasting blood sug- ar, lipid profiles, liver and kidney function test are carried out at least twice a year.

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-53 .unnumbered}

-   To abolish symptoms

-   To restore functioning to the maximum level possible

-   To reduce the chances of recurrence

-   To monitor blood glucose, lipid profiles, liver and kidney function at least twice a year for patients on olanzapine and risperidone

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-70 .unnumbered}

-   Supportive psychotherapy

-   Rehabilitation

-   Family therapy

-   Psychoeducation about cause, course, treatment, side effects and relapse prevention

-   Behaviour Therapy e.g. social skills training, progressive muscle relaxation, coping skills, etc.

Bipolar disorder is a form of mood disorder. The term refers to a condition in which patients experience mood swings between the two extremes of depression and mania. Bipolar disorder is referred to in older literature as manic-depressive illness. It is important to note that the affected patient usually presents with one predominant mood state at a time, either depression or mania.

A single manic episode and a history of depression qualify for classification as bipolar disorder. A current episode of depression without a past manic episode is not diagnosed as a bipolar disorder. Repeated depressive episodes are diagnosed as recurrent depression.

These occur following sudden withdrawal from alcohol. They are often seen 12 to 18 hours after the last drink, but may be earlier and are worst between 24 to 48 hours after onset. This commonly occurs in patients admitted to hospital for other problems e.g. arising from accidents or physical illnesses, which keeps them from drinking. The presentation varies from minimal tremors to states of full-blown agitation and confusion, which are potentially fatal.

## Causes {#causes-66 .unnumbered}

-   Abrupt cessation or significant reduction in alcohol intake in an individual with heavy drinking over many months or years

Anxiety is a common symptom that occurs in all psychiatric disorders including depressive illness and most psychoses. Physical diseases like hyperthyroidism, cardiac disease or hypertension may also present with anxiety and therefore must be excluded.

There are various forms of anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, acute stress disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, etc.), but the common ones seen in general practice are generalized anxiety disorders and panic disorders.

In all cases of suspected anxiety disorders, it is important to assess the scope of the anxiety, including the antecedents, behaviour and consequences of anxiety for the patient through an indepth interview. It is also important to ask about the presence of obsessive thoughts and/ or compulsions as these are increasingly common and tend not to be reported out of embarrassment but which lead to much personal distress. In this case refer to a psychiatrist.

In generalized anxiety disorders, there is excessive anxiety and worry about events or activities, such as performance at school or work,

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

occurring on most days, for at least 6 months.

A panic disorder refers to a pattern of recurrent unexpected attacks of intense fear or discomfort over a discrete period more than 3 times a week. During attacks 4 or more of the symptoms listed below develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. Panic disorders are accompanied by persistent concern about having another attack or worrying about implications of having an attack.

In children especially, partial complex seizures may mimic panic attacks. Medications are required to treat panic disorders only if the attacks occur frequently enough to cause distress.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-77 .unnumbered}

Refer children with symptoms suggestive of a panic disorder to a paediatrician. Also refer patients to a psychologist for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and to a psychiatrist for additional drug therapy where indicated.

> **Chapter 10:** Psychiatric Disorders

Abuse of substances such as marijuana, benzodiazepines, heroine, cocaine etc. is prevalent in many communities around the country. Typically, individuals with such disorders request help only after they are forced to do so by family members. They may also begin to have withdrawal symptoms when on admission for serious physical illness. This is because they have no access to the substance being abused. This may complicate treatment of the primary disease for which they were admitted.

## Causes {#causes-70 .unnumbered}

-   Social factors

    -   Peer pressure (e.g. family members, friends)

    -   Lack of coping skills (e.g. with life's difficulties, aids to coping in times of trouble)

-   Addiction

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-78 .unnumbered}

Refer for specialist psychiatrist/clinical psychologist care and management if withdrawal symptoms are particularly distressful and do not respond to treatment or when there are repeated relapses.

Refer for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy to a clinical psychologist.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by qualitative impairments occuring in a child before the age of 36 months, in three key areas; social interaction (often the earliest features of Autistic Spectrum Disorder-ASD), communication, interests and activities.

The clinical presentation is varied and may encompass children with severe manifestations of the above features or with more subtle behavioural deficits, hence the use of the term Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Learning disability in this condition is very common and the risk of epilepsy is significant.

A boil or furuncle is a deep bacterial infection of the hair follicles. A more superficial infection is termed folliculitis. Several boils grouped in an area and discharging pus from several points is termed a carbuncle. Patients with recurrent boils or carbuncles should be screened for diabetes mellitus and skin disorders such as scabies, pediculosis or eczema while patients with repeated folliculitis in the shaving areas, e.g. face and armpits should be educated on shaving techniques.

Impetigo is a highly contagious superficial bacterial skin infection. It is common in neonates and children and may be associated with conditions such as scabies, eczema, lice infestation and herpes simplex infection as

> **Chapter 11:** Disorders of the Skin

secondary infection. The condition does not cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure. It usually improves within a week of treatment.

There are two types of impetigo. The non-bullous type typically affects the skin around the nose and mouth, causing lesions to develop, that quickly burst to leave a yellow-brown crust. The other type, bullous impetigo, typically affects the trunk causing fluid-filled blisters (bullae) to develop that burst after a few days to leave a yellow crust.

Both types of impetigo may leave behind marks when the crusts have cleared up, but these usually improve over the following days or weeks.

Its prevention involves good hygiene, regular hand-washing, trimming of fingernails to reduce breaking of the skin through scratching, and discouraging the sharing of towels and clothing.

(See section on 'Cellulitis' in Disorders of the Musculoskeletal system)

This is a chronic painless necrotising ulcer with undermined edges, which can lead to debilitating skin and soft tissue infection and permanent disfigurement. While it is known that this ulcer is caused by a bacterium, the mode of transmission remains unclear. However, trauma, insect bite and inhalation have been suggested.

When detected early, the majority can be cured with a combination of antibiotics. Thus, early identification and appropriate management reduce morbidity and disability from this condition.

Yaws is a chronic infection by a bacterium that affects mainly the skin, bone and cartilage. Most people affected are children under 15 years of age but adults are not exempt. It is transmitted mainly through skin contact with an infected person. A single skin lesion develops at the point of entry of the bacterium after 24 weeks. Without treatment, multiple lesions appear all over the body. The disease is rarely fatal, however it can lead to chronic disfigurement and disability in about 10% of affected individuals if left untreated. Treatment with antibiotics is curative and relapse is rare.

Overcrowding, poor personal hygiene and poor sanitation facilitate the spread of the disease.

Pityriasis versicolor is a common yeast infection of the skin, in which flaky discoloured patches appear on the chest and back. It is sometimes called tinea versicolor. It is more common in hot climates, and often affects people that perspire heavily. It is a disorder of the healthy but florid cases are seen in the immunosuppressed such as those with diabetes mellitus, HIV/AIDS and topical steroid abuse.

This is an acute painful blistering viral infection of the skin. It can occur in childhood but is much more common in adults, especially the elderly, sick or immunosuppressed. The primary infection presents as chickenpox (varicella), usually during childhood. Like herpes simplex, the virus persists usually in the anterior horn cells before it is reactivated. Post- herpetic neuralgia is a common complication and defined as persistence or recurrence of pain more than a month after the onset of shingles.

Refer complicated cases to a specialist.

Chicken pox and shingles are caused by the same virus (Varicella or Herpes Zoster). Humans are the only source of infection for chicken pox and shingles. Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with vesicular fluid from patients with either condition. Chicken pox may additionally be transmitted by airborne spread from respiratory tract secretions. There is a risk of infection up to 21 days after contact.

Chicken pox is a highly contagious viral illness usually occurring in epidemics. It is generally a benign, self-limiting disease in immuno- competent children but tends to be more severe in adolescents and adults and also in immunosuppressed patients e.g. patients on steroids. Complications include bacterial super-infection of skin lesions, pneumonia, central nervous system involvement (acute cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis), thrombocytopenia, and other rare complications such as glomerulonephritis, arthritis, and hepatitis.

Exposure to the virus during the second 20 weeks of pregnancy can result in congenital varicella syndrome characterised by skin scarring, abnormalities of limbs, brain, eyes and low birth weight. Varicella infection can be fatal for an infant if the mother develops varicella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery.

Shingles presents with skin lesions in a dermatomal distribution and in immunocompromised individuals, can be very extensive. It may be complicated by pain persisting for weeks to years after the infection

Predisposing and underlying disease needs to be investigated. Complications include deformity, ankylosis of joints, osteomyelitis, cellulitis and malignant transformation of ulcers. Surgical treatment may be needed.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-89 .unnumbered}

Refer patients with ulcers failing to show signs of healing with above treatment, and patients who would require surgery either for skin grafting, wound excision or limb amputation to a surgical specialist. All ulcers suspected to be malignant should also be referred to a surgical specialist.

> **Chapter 11:** Disorders of the Skin

Pruritus or itching is an unpleasant sensation on the skin that provokes the desire to rub or scratch the area. Itching can cause discomfort and frustration. In severe cases it can lead to disturbed sleep, anxiety and depression. Constant scratching to obtain relief can damage the skin and reduce its effectiveness as a major protective barrier. Treatment of pruritus must address the underlying condition. Diagnosis therefore needs to be made for effective treatment.

Urticaria or wheal is a transient, itchy swelling of the skin secondary to the release of histamine. Each episode of wheal may last a few minutes or several hours and may change shape. Wheals may be round, or form

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

rings, a map-like pattern or giant patches. The surface wheals may be accompanied by deeper swelling of mucous membrane such as the eyelids, lips, hands and other parts of the body. The deeper swelling is called angioedema.

Urticaria is classified as acute urticaria if the condition lasts less than six (6) weeks and chronic urticaria if it lasts more than six (6) weeks. Causes of acute urticarias can easily be identified as against those for chronic urticaria.

## Causes {#causes-83 .unnumbered}

-   Medicines e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins, aspirin, NSAIDS, toxoids, animal sera, morphine, radiocontrast media, ACE inhibitors

-   Foods e.g. fish, nuts, eggs, chocolate, shellfish, pork, spices, milk, cheese, food dyes, additives

-   Plants

-   Idiopathic

-   Environmental and physical factors

    -   Pressure urticaria: wheals appear on the area of skin experienc- ing any form of pressure e.g. soles of feet after prolong standing

    -   Solar, cold and heat urticaria: wheals appear when exposed to these environments

    -   Aquagenic urticaria: exposure to water leads to itchy wheals

    -   Cholinergic urticaria: intense pruritic wheals are seen in re- sponse to sweating, exercise, emotions, and hot foods

    -   Dermographism: linear wheals noticed as a result of scratching

These are immunologic reactions characterized by reddening with or without blistering of the skin and/or mucosa. The common types are erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

necrolysis (TEN). With all these conditions, there could be accompanying extensive denudation of skin with consequent fluid and electrolyte loss and a risk of secondary bacterial infection. All three conditions should be considered as emergencies requiring intensive care.

Erythema multiforme presents as itchy, target-like, non-scaly lesions of the palms, soles, forearms and legs.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by erythema and blister formation, which additionally involves the mucous membranes (conjunctiva, mouth, genitals etc.).

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a generalized scalded type of skin reaction, often due to an allergic reaction to drugs. A similar reaction occurs in children termed staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, which is caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-93 .unnumbered}

Refer patients not responding to treatment to a dermatologist. Suspected underlying endocrine conditions should be referred to an endocrinologist.

Eczema or dermatitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory reaction in the skin often due to an external (exogenous) or internal (endogenous) factor. Exogenous eczema (contact eczema) includes primary irritant dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Endogenous eczema includes atopic eczema, seborrhoiec eczema, discoid eczema, asteatotic eczema, varicose eczema and endogenous hand and soles dermatitis.

Contact dermatitis may be an irritant (concentration dependent) or allergic (delayed hypersensitivity) reaction to specific external substance such as metals, rubber, chemicals etc. In contrast to the endogenous types, the skin reaction is confined to the areas directly in contact with the offending substance or allergen.

Atopic eczema is a common chronic but self-limiting pruritic skin disorder mainly of childhood but sometimes persists into adult life. The rash usually appears within the first year of life, mostly between ages 2 and 4 months. In older children the rash characteristically involves the flexural areas. A familial background of atopy (asthma, hay fever, eosinophilia, allergic rhinitis and similar skin problem) is often present. The condition is characterised by relapses and remissions.

Seborrhoiec eczema presents as a scaly, flaking, dry and reddened rash of the scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, perioral, periorbital and periauricular skins. Sometimes it presents as hypopigmented macules. It may be associated with *Pityrosporum ovale* infection. Extensive forms are associated with immunosuppressive states, particularly HIV/AIDS and diabetes mellitus.

## Causes {#causes-86 .unnumbered}

-   Genetic

-   Irritants (e.g. acids, alkalis, detergents, petroleum products)

-   Allergens (e.g. nickel, rubber, additives, chromates, hair dyes, topical medicaments, plants, nail varnish, cosmetics etc.)

Intertrigo is the term used to describe a rash in body folds or apposing skin surfaces such as axillae, groin, submammary regions, beneath an abdominal apron of fat, finger or toe web spaces. Affected skin is reddened and uncomfortable. Intertrigo is particularly common in those who are overweight and patients with diabetes mellitus.

Body folds (flexures) are prone to inflammatory rashes because of relatively high skin temperature and moisture from insensible water loss. Sweating that is not easy to evaporate and friction from movement of adjacent skin, results in the sore skin.

# Chapter {#chapter-11 .unnumbered}

Diabetes mellitus is characterised by persistently elevated blood glucose levels. If left untreated or improperly treated for long periods this will result in widespread blood vessel damage and complications relating to the eyes, kidneys, heart, brain and nerves. There is an increased risk of lower limb amputations, poor fertility and pregnancy outcomes with improper glucose control.

Although children and adolescents often present with acute symptoms, many adults with diabetes are asymptomatic. It is therefore necessary to exclude diabetes in all persons, especially adults, attending health facilities for routine medical examinations, first out-patient review, ante-natal care, elective and emergency admissions or undergoing surgical procedures.

The non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions in diabetes management are usually life-long.

Individuals found to have venous or capillary plasma glucose levels in the pre-diabetes or diabetes ranges, as shown in the table below, will need further assessment to confirm the diagnosis.

## Causes {#causes-88 .unnumbered}

-   Autoimmune disorder (Type 1 diabetes)

-   Idiopathic (Type 1 diabetes)

-   Genetic factors causing a defect in the action or secretion of insulin (Type 2 diabetes)

-   Environmental factors e.g. excessive calorie intake and lack of physical activity (Type 2 diabetes)

-   Pregnancy (Gestational diabetes)

-   Secondary diabetes:

    -   Medication e.g. corticosteroid use or abuse

    -   Pancreatic disease or pancreatectomy

    -   Endocrine disorders e.g. Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly etc.

## Symptoms {#symptoms-92 .unnumbered}

    -   Fasting blood glucose between 4-7 mmol/L (less intensive gly- caemic targets in elderly patients)

    -   2-hour post-meal blood glucose between 5-9 mmol/L (less in- tensive glycaemic targets in elderly patients)

    -   Glycated haemoglobin 7 % or less (less intensive glycaemic tar- gets in elderly patients)

-   To ensure weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals

-   To prevent chronic complications of diabetes by maintaining

    -   The glycaemic targets noted above

    -   Blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg

| -   Intake of alcohol is prohibited for individuals less than 18      |
|     years of age. While low consumption is permissible in adult       |
|     patients, moderate to heavy drinking of alcohol increases the     |

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-96 .unnumbered}

All individuals with diabetes must be referred to a dietician for dietary advice. All children with diabetes must be seen by a specialist (paediatrician or endocrinologist). All patients in whom glycaemic targets cannot be achieved as well as those with diabetes complications must be referred to the appropriate specialist.

All type 2 diabetics at diagnosis and type 1 diabetics 5 years after diagnosis should be referred to an eye specialist for screening for Diabetic Retinopathy.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a condition associated with high blood glucose (usually \> 18 mmol/L), which nonetheless, is unavailable to the body tissues as a source of energy. Fat is therefore broken down as an alternative source of energy, releasing toxic chemicals called ketones as a by-product. Additionally, there is severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in DKA, especially low potassium. It is a common cause of death among diabetes patients in Ghana. It often occurs in type 1 diabetes patients but may also occur in type 2 diabetes.

In contrast, the Hyperosmolar Non-Ketotic state (HONK) in diabetes occurs primarily in Type 2 patients, and is similar in its clinical presentation to diabetic ketoacidosis in many respects. A major difference, however, is

the absence of a significant amount of ketones in the urine (usually trace or 1+) and the presence of severe dehydration. The management of this condition is similar to that of DKA.

## Causes {#causes-89 .unnumbered}

-   Severe deficiency of insulin

-   Interruption of anti-hyperglycaemic therapy (usually for financial reasons or for alternative treatment)

-   Stress of intercurrent illness (e.g. infection, myocardial infarction,

> stroke, surgery, complicated pregnancy etc.)

## Symptoms {#symptoms-93 .unnumbered}

-   Polyuria

-   Polydipsia

-   Nausea, vomiting

-   Abdominal pain

-   Alteration in sensorium or collapse

-   Symptoms of infection or other underlying condition

## Signs {#signs-91 .unnumbered}

-   Dehydration (dry skin, reduced skin turgor or sunken eyes)

-   Deep and fast breathing

-   Low blood pressure

-   Fast and weak pulse

-   'Fruity' breath (smell of acetone)

-   Confusion, stupor or unconsciousness

-   Evidence of infection, recent surgery, stroke etc.

## Investigations {#investigations-94 .unnumbered}

-   Random blood glucose (usually \>18 mmol/L)

-   Urine glucose (usually \>3+)

-   Urine ketones (usually \>2+)

-   Blood urea and electrolytes (usually low potassium, however if in renal failure urea and potassium may be high)

-   Blood film for malaria parasites

-   Full blood count (raised white cell count would suggest bacterial infection)

-   Urine culture

-   Blood culture

-   Chest X-ray (for pneumonia)

-   Arterial blood gases

-   Electrocardiogram (to identify hypokalaemia, and in adult patients to exclude acute myocardial infarction as a precipitating factor)

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-72 .unnumbered}

-   To replace the fluid losses

-   To replace the electrolyte losses, especially potassium

> **Chapter 12:** Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders

-   To replace deficient insulin

-   To seek the underlying cause and treat appropriately

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-83 .unnumbered}

## Management of Hyperosmolar Non-Ketotic state (HONK)

(See 'Management of DKA' above)

## Adjunct Treatment for DKA and HONK

-   Broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections (See appropriate section)

-   Treat malaria if suspected or confirmed (See appropriate section)

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-97 .unnumbered}

If there are inadequate resources for managing the patient, start 0.9% Sodium Chloride, IV, and give initial dose of soluble or regular insulin IV or IM after confirming blood glucose and urine ketone levels and refer to a nearby regional or teaching hospital.

If the patient remains comatose or fails to pass adequate amounts of urine despite management, refer to a regional or teaching hospital for further care.

(See section on 'Diabetes in Pregnancy' under 'Obstetric care and Obstetric Disorders')

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Hypoglycaemia refers to a blood glucose level below 3.6 mmol/L. It is more common in elderly diabetics and those with kidney function impairment as well as those on long-acting oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications or insulin. Severe hypoglycaemia (blood glucose \< 2.2 mmol/L) may result in alteration of consciousness, fits, self-injury and various degrees of irreversible brain damage.

Following successful treatment of hypoglycaemia, its cause must be determined and measures, including patient education and revision of anti-hyperglycaemic drug doses, should be taken to prevent its recurrence.

## Causes {#causes-90 .unnumbered}

-   Overdose of any anti-hyperglycaemic medication i.e. insulin or oral agent

-   Antihyperglycaemic medication use in renal impairment and the

> elderly

-   Omitted or inadequate amount of food

-   Unaccustomed physical over-activity

-   Excessive alcohol intake

## Symptoms {#symptoms-94 .unnumbered}

-   Dizziness

-   Blurred vision

-   Headaches

-   Palpitation

-   Sweating

-   Shaking of the hands and body

-   Unconsciousness

-   Convulsions

-   Irritability and abnormal behaviour especially in children

## Signs {#signs-92 .unnumbered}

-   Sweating

-   Tremors

-   Tachycardia and bounding pulse

-   Confusion

-   Unconsciousness

-   Convulsions

## Investigations {#investigations-95 .unnumbered}

-   Random blood glucose (urgently done using a glucose meter)

-   Blood urea and electrolytes

-   Liver function tests

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-73 .unnumbered}

-   To rapidly restore blood glucose levels to normal

> **Chapter 12:** Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders

-   To maintain the level of blood glucose within the normal range until the patient can begin eating normally

-   To identify and address the cause

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-94 .unnumbered}

-   Mild hypoglycaemia

    -   2-3 teaspoons of granulated sugar or 3 cubes of sugar or ½ a bottle of soft drink (sugar-containing, not 'diet' drinks) to indi- viduals who are conscious.

    -   A glass of milk or fruit drink and a tablespoonful of honey are useful alternatives

    -   The above measures should be followed immediately by a meal

> or snack

-   Moderate hypoglycaemia

    -   Same as for mild hypoglycaemia, but repeat after 10 minutes. If no improvement is observed, treat as for severe hypoglycaemia

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-84 .unnumbered}

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-98 .unnumbered}

If the patient does not respond to the above treatment recommendations, refer to a specialist.

There is ample evidence linking high blood cholesterol levels to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) events, including myocardial infarction, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. On the other hand, there is also evidence for significant reduction in morbidity and mortality from CVDs by reducing blood cholesterol levels in those at risk (primary prevention) and those who have suffered a CVD event (secondary prevention).

The commonly assessed blood lipid parameters are total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, the primary target for intervention is the LDL-cholesterol level. As treatment may be for long periods or lifelong, periodic monitoring of liver and muscle enzymes (transaminases and creatine kinase) and blood glucose are advisable to forestall medication-related side effects.

A goitre is a swelling of the front of the neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland. It may affect persons of any age. Not all neck swellings are goitres. Goitres are usually benign but may occasionally be malignant. They could be associated with normal, reduced or excessive function of the thyroid gland. A reduction in production of thyroid hormones results in hypothyroidism while an excess results in hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Abnormalities of thyroid hormone production may also occur in the absence of goitre.

Proper diagnosis and selection of appropriate surgical or non-surgical treatment of benign and malignant goitres is by full clinical assessment and investigations. Treatment is not necessarily by increasing iodine intake e.g. in iodated salt. Excess iodine intake may actually be harmful in some cases.

## Causes {#causes-92 .unnumbered}

-   Simple non-toxic goitre or endemic goitre

-   Hypothyroidism (See section on 'Hypothyroidism')

-   Hyperthyroidism or Thyrotoxicosis (See section on 'Hyperthyroidism')

-   Thyroid neoplasm - benign or malignant

## Symptoms {#symptoms-96 .unnumbered}

-   Swelling in the neck

-   Breathing and swallowing difficulty, if large

-   Symptoms of hypothyroidism (See section on 'Hypothyroidism')

-   Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (See section on 'Hyperthyroidism')

## Signs {#signs-94 .unnumbered}

-   Diffuse (smooth) or nodular (irregular) thyroid swelling

-   Signs of hypothyroidism (See section on 'Hypothyroidism')

-   Signs of hyperthyroidism (See section on 'Hyperthyroidism')

## Investigations {#investigations-97 .unnumbered}

-   Thyroid function tests -- free T3, free T4, TSH

> **Chapter 12:** Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders

-   Thyroid ultrasound scan

-   Thyroid autoantibodies (if necessary)

-   Radioisotope scan of thyroid (if necessary)

-   Fine needle aspiration cytology (if necessary)

-   X-ray of the neck including thoracic inlet view for large goitres

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-74 .unnumbered}

-   To assess and correct level of thyroid hormone production

-   To reduce symptoms associated with thyrotoxicosis

-   To reduce or prevent obstructive symptoms

-   To identify thyroid neoplasms and manage appropriately

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-96 .unnumbered}

-   Subtotal thyroidectomy where indicated

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-86 .unnumbered}

-   Appropriate treatment of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (See

sections on 'Hypothyroidism' and 'Hyperthyroidism')

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-100 .unnumbered}

Refer patients to a physician or surgical specialist where complications (e.g. hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, breathing difficulty etc.) or malignancy are suspected or if full clinical assessment and investigations are not possible.

Hypothyroidism is a condition associated with reduction in thyroid hormone production. Thyroid hormone is required for normal metabolism and growth. Its deficiency has major consequences on foetal development as well as intellectual and physical development in infants and children (cause of cretinism).

In adults, it may be the cause of several problems including heart disease, menstrual irregularity and infertility, mental health conditions and dementia. Iodine replacement is not the treatment for hypothyroidism.

Screening for hypothyroidism in all new borns, and every 5 years in adults after age 35 years, especially females, by measuring TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels in blood where this is possible, should be encouraged.

## Causes {#causes-93 .unnumbered}

-   Antibody-related thyroid gland destruction

-   Subtotal thyroidectomy

-   Pituitary surgery or lesions

-   Congenital

-   Severe iodine deficiency

Adrenal insufficiency arises when the adrenal gland is destroyed by disease, or atrophies following pituitary failure or chronic corticosteroid use or abuse. In these situations, the amount of cortisol produced from the adrenal gland is insufficient to meet the body's needs during periods of physical and psychological stress or severe illness. The condition is associated with severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance and results in acute circulatory collapse.

## Causes {#causes-95 .unnumbered}

-   Sudden cessation of prolonged corticosteroid use or abuse.

-   Stress (e.g. infection, severe trauma, surgery, and dental procedures) in a patient with undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency or patients on prolonged corticosteroid treatment.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-103 .unnumbered}

All patients suspected to have adrenal insufficiency should be referred, after resuscitation, to a regional or teaching hospital for assessment and long-term management.

This condition results from high levels of cortisol in the blood and is associated with various changes in the body including the development of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and osteoporosis. The prolonged use or abuse (especially by women for cosmetic reasons) of oral or topical corticosteroids such as prednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone or cortisone, or preparations containing any of these drugs, is also a cause.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-104 .unnumbered}

Refer all suspected cases to an endocrinologist or specialist physician in a regional or teaching hospital for the appropriate investigations and management.

Overweight and obesity are associated with conditions that cause premature ill-health and death, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease and stroke. Other conditions such as gout, obstructive sleep apnoea, gallstones, heartburn, arthritis, skin infections as well as various cancers have been linked to excess body weight. They also increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as elevated blood cholesterol, which increases the risk for heart attacks and strokes.

Weight reduction often corrects, or helps to control, these associated conditions. Occasionally rapid weight gain may be associated with an underlying endocrine condition such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome.

# Chapter {#chapter-12 .unnumbered}

Antenatal care refers to the comprehensive care given to a pregnant woman to ensure that she goes through pregnancy, labour and the puerperium safely with the delivery of a healthy baby.

The recommended approach to antenatal care is known as Focused Antenatal Care. It has the following principles: emphasizes quality of care rather than quantity of care (four comprehensive antenatal visits recommended for women with normal pregnancy); individualized care that meets each woman's own medical and psychosocial needs; and disease detection instead of risk categorization based on the simple principle that all pregnant women are at risk of complications.

Pregnant woman should be carefully assessed at booking and at all subsequent visits to identify problems that are likely to have an adverse effect on the pregnancy. Pregnancies with risk conditions (one or more risk factors) should be seen more frequently and also referred to a hospital and/or obstetrician for management.

Another important component of antenatal care is the health education and counselling that is given to clients. These promote healthy behaviour and lifestyle during the pregnancy and also enable the woman to recognize danger signs in pregnancy and prepare adequately for emergencies and safe delivery. Findings at each visit should be accurately documented.

Antenatal Visits Schedule for a Normal Healthy Woman

Women who are healthy at booking and who remain healthy at subsequent visits and do not have any identified potential risk conditions may have four comprehensive visits as follows:

This refers to excessive vomiting usually during the early part of pregnancy, and is usually common. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and therefore important to rule out other causes of vomiting such as malaria, urinary tract infection, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, hepatitis and hypoglycaemia. Surgical conditions such as acute appendicitis, bowel obstruction, cholecystitis and twisted ovarian cyst, should also be excluded. Hyperemesis gravidarum may be associated with multiple pregnancy or molar pregnancy.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-108 .unnumbered}

Refer all cases of super-imposed pre-eclampsia or other obstetric complication promptly to a hospital or obstetrician after initiation of treatment.

Pre-eclampsia is a disease specifically associated with pregnancy. It usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and it is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The presence of pedal oedema or excessive weight gain may also be a feature of pre-eclampsia.

Blood pressure monitoring every 4 hours together with daily weighing of the patient are essential in the management of pre-eclampsia alongside the recommended investigations.

While blood pressure reduction is essential, lowering the blood pressure below 140/90mmHg may cause foetal distress and should be avoided.

## Causes {#causes-100 .unnumbered}

The cause is unknown but the disease is more commonly associated with the following:

-   Primigravidae

-   Maternal age (women \< 18 or \> 35 years)

-   Multiple pregnancies

-   Hydatidiform mole

-   Medical disorders e.g. polycystic ovaries, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney disorders

-   First pregnancy with a new partner

-   Previous history of pre-eclampsia

-   Family history of pre-eclampsia

## Symptoms {#symptoms-104 .unnumbered}

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-109 .unnumbered}

Refer all cases of severe pre-eclampsia and imminent eclampsia promptly to a hospital or obstetrician after initiation of treatment.

When the "obstetrician" considers that the foetus is immature, the patient should be transferred to a hospital capable of looking after the immature baby.

Eclampsia occurs as a complication of worsening pre-eclampsia. The blood pressure is high with associated proteinuria and convulsion or eclamptic fit, which is similar to an epileptic fit with tonic and clonic phases followed by coma. The fits are often repetitive and of short duration (60-90 seconds).

Anaemia in pregnancy is a haemoglobin concentration of \< 11 g/ dL (World Health Organisation). It is described as severe if the Hb is \< 7 g/dL. Anaemia has adverse effects on the health of the woman and the outcome of the pregnancy. It is associated with an increased rate of

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

miscarriage, preterm delivery, foetal growth restriction, foetal death and increased perinatal loss. It is also associated with ante- and post-partum haemorrhage and an increased maternal mortality rate.

Ideally no woman should go into labour with anaemia. Appropriate measures including blood transfusion may be required to correct the anaemia especially if a woman is close to her expected delivery date.

Pregnancy in the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patient is associated with poor obstetric outcomes for both the mother and her baby. Data from referral centres in Ghana show that sickle cell complications during pregnancy leads to high maternal and perinatal mortality.

Common pregnancy complications of the mother with SCD include miscarriages, frequent vaso-occlusive crises, severe anaemia, recurrent urinary tract infections, acute chest syndrome, preterm labour and

> **Chapter 13:** Obstetric Care and Obstetric Disorders

pulmonary embolism. In the foetus, complications include intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity and intrauterine foetal death.

Care by a multidisciplinary team consisting of the Obstetricican, Physician specialist, Haematologist, Clinical Pharmacist, Anaesthetist, Nurse and Midwife ensures good health outcomes for these patients.

[At booking]{.underline}

-   Assess patient carefully for risk of frequent crises, and previous obstetric complications

-   Examine for nutritional status, anaemia, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegally

-   Perform ultrasound to date pregnancy and exclude foetal abnormality and growth retardation

-   Perform the above listed investigations to screen for and detect complications

-   Manage identified problems at booking (e.g. urinary tract infection, malaria etc.) appropriately and promptly

[Follow up visits]{.underline}

-   If low risk, schedule follow up visits monthly until 2nd trimester, then 2 weekly until 28th week and thereafter weekly

-   If high-risk, schedule visits 2 weekly until third trimester, then weekly until term

-   At review visits, enquire about maternal well-being, symptoms of crises, infection and foetal activity. Examine for pallor, jaundice, fever and proteinuria. Check for foetal growth and compare to gestational age

## Labour and delivery {#labour-and-delivery .unnumbered}

-   Stress and pain of labour and delivery can trigger crisis. Risks of crisis is increased if dehydration, fever, infection, hypothermia develop during labour. Care during labour/delivery is targeted at preventing these triggers

-   All women with Sickle cell Disease must deliver in hospital, and the most experienced midwife and obstetrician should be involved in their care

-   In uncomplicated pregnancies, spontaneous vaginal delivery must be aimed at until 40 weeks (term). Induction must be undertaken only if the woman has not delivered after this time.

-   For the high risk women with recurrent complications deliver as soon

> as baby is viable

-   At admission in labour;

    -   Labour should be monitored closely with partograph

    -   Check for haemoglobin level

    -   Group and cross-match a unit of blood on standby

    -   Maintain good hydration with IV fluids

    -   Provide adequate pain relief (See section on 'Analgesia in La-

> bour')

Diabetes Mellitus in pregnancy includes individuals known to be diabetic prior to pregnancy and those who develop impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes refers to impaired glucose tolerance of any degree that develops or is first recognized during the current pregnancy, irrespective of whether it resolves after delivery or not. Diabetes is associated with poor health outcomes for a mother and her baby if not properly managed. Many patients with gestational diabetes are asymptomatic making screening for all pregnant women mandatory to identify those at risk. A fasting blood glucose test must be done on all pregnant women at booking and also at 28-32 weeks (See section on 'Antenatal Care').

The management of diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and the puerperium involves close monitoring of the woman by a multidisciplinary approach comprising a team of obstetricians, midwives, nurses, dieticians, physicians, anaesthetists and paediatricians.

Labour (induced or spontaneous) and Caesarean section are best supervised in hospital under specialist care.

Anti-diabetic treatment requirements reduce dramatically after delivery hence, post delivery treatment doses must be tailored to each individual patient's needs.

The newborn baby of a diabetic mother needs special care and is best managed by a paediatrician/ neonatologist. Hypoglycaemia in the baby in the first few hours of birth is a major problem. It can be prevented by initiating early (within 1 hour) breastfeeding. They may also require management for respiratory distress syndrome, electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia) and hyperbilirubinaemia.

> All diabetic mothers must be counselled on family planning.

## And/Or {#andor-7 .unnumbered}

-   Insulin

Evidence Rating: \[A\]

(See section on Insulin Therapy in 'Diabetes Mellitus')

-   Start with small doses (e.g. total daily dose of 6-10 units) of NPH insulin or premixed insulin (which has 30% of regular and 70% of NPH insulin), subcutaneously.

-   Give approximately two-thirds of the total daily dose before breakfast and one-third before dinner.

-   Adjust the insulin doses before breakfast and/or dinner by plus or minus 2 units according to results of blood glucose tests.

-   Monitor insulin therapy with 2-4 weekly FBS (and 2-hour post- prandial blood glucose where possible) up to 34 weeks then weekly till delivery.

-   Keep fasting glucose levels between 4-6 mmol/L and 2-hour postprandial glucose between 4-7 mmol/L.

-   This is often achievable on an out-patient basis. However, some patients would need to be admitted to hospital for short periods to ensure good glycaemic control.

-   Insulin requirements during labour should be given according to a sliding scale (See section on 'Diabetic ketoacidosis' and Sliding scale)

-   Insulin requirements during caesarean section and other operative procedures (using a sliding scale or Glucose-Potassium-Insulin infusion or GKI) should be discussed with the anaesthetist

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-113 .unnumbered}

Refer to hospital for specialist care. For the convenience of patients shared care between specialist and medical officer may be appropriate.

Cardiac diseases are associated with high maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity. They may be present before the pregnancy or develop during the pregnancy or puerperium (e.g. peripartum cardiomyopathy). Pregnancy places additional burden on the heart and makes pre-existing cardiac disease worse.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Some of the signs of pregnancy may mimic cardiac disease. Careful assessment of all patients must be undertaken to determine if they have cardiac disease or not.

Management requires a multi-disciplinary team including the obstetrician, neonatologist, anaesthetist and physician specialist or cardiologist.

Patients with known cardiac disease must plan their pregnancies carefully in full consultation with their cardiologist and obstetrician. They must book early as soon as they become pregnant for antenatal care in hospital.

All patients needing pharmacological treatment must be managed by a physician specialist or cardiologist and obstetrician.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

The pain threshold may be low during labour on account of fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Adequate pain relief during labour results in less anxiety and good progress.

In the first stage of labour pain relief may be required for painful uterine contractions, whereas in the second stage of labour, analgesia is required for instrumental delivery and when an episiotomy is given.

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-104 .unnumbered}

Preterm labour refers to labour occurring after 28 weeks but before

37 completed weeks resulting in premature delivery. The preterm newborn is at risk of death because all its body systems such as lungs, brain, digestive and immune systems are not fully developed. There is increased susceptibility to infection and impaired clotting mechanisms. The baby is also at risk of birth injuries such as cerebral haemorrhage because the fragile cranial bones do not provide sufficient protection for the brain. Some risk factors for preterm labour include young age of mothers, poor socio-economic class and smoking.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-118 .unnumbered}

Treatment is best done in a hospital where the facilities can support the adequate care of the preterm neonate. Therefore, refer the mother if the clinic cannot adequately care for the immature neonate. It is better to transfer the foetus in-utero to the referral centre.

This is the rupture of the membranes before the onset of labour. The two types are preterm (before 37 completed weeks) and term (after 37 weeks, but ≥ 1 hour before onset of labour).

## Signs {#signs-112 .unnumbered}

-   Speculum examination reveals clear fluid from the cervical os or pool of fluid in the posterior vaginal fornix

-   Smaller uterine size for the gestational age

-   If complicated by infection (chorioamnionitis)

    -   Fever

    -   Purulent vaginal discharge

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-120 .unnumbered}

Refer to a gynaecologist if pain interferes with normal activity especially if treatment is ineffective or an underlying cause is identified.

Abortion refers to the expulsion of the foetus and other products of conception before the 28th week of pregnancy. It may occur spontaneously (threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete or missed) or be induced (therapeutic, criminal). Both spontaneous and induced abortion may become complicated by infection (sepsis) and/or profuse bleeding.

After appropriate treatment and discharge from hospital, it is recommended that patients report back to hospital if there is lower abdominal pain, fever, vaginal bleeding and malodorous discharge. A follow up review should also be done in two weeks.

## Causes {#causes-112 .unnumbered}

-   Spontaneous Abortions

    -   Infections e.g. malaria, UTI, bacterial vaginosis etc.

> **[INDUCED (SAFE) ABORTION]{.underline}**

This refers to the deliberate termination of pregnancy. Termination of pregnancy is requested for and done for reasons permissible by law either through a surgical procedure or by pharmacological means. Under the current provisions for Ghana, an induced abortion may be carried out legally only under the following conditions: in case of rape, defilement or incest; threat to the physical and mental health of the mother; presence of foetal abnormality and mental retardation of the mother.

Patients given a pharmacological option for abortion will need to be monitored closely for completeness of the abortion process. They should be informed to report back immediately in cases of profuse or heavy vaginal bleeding, fever or offensive vaginal discharge.

This refers to bleeding which deviates from the normal menstrual pattern (in terms of the amount, duration or interval). Abnormal menstrual patterns and bleeding are common in young adolescents and women within the ages of 45-50 years. No cause may be found on investigation in these age groups as it is mostly due to immaturity or ageing of the ovaries and its pituitary controls.

Bleeding may be mild or severe and life threatening.

In other age groups, the causes are multiple and may be associated with the identifiable disorders. Postmenopausal bleeding is said to occur when a woman who has stopped having menstruation for 6-12 or more months begins to bleed per vagina. Occasionally bleeding from the rectum and urethra may be confused with genital tract bleeding.

Treatment is directed at the cause found.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-122 .unnumbered}

Refer all women with heavy menstrual bleeding and/or abnormal vaginal bleeding not responding to therapy to a gynaecologist for comprehensive assessment and management.

While a vaginal discharge is a notable clinical feature of a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI), not all forms of vaginal discharge are abnormal or indicative of an STI. Vaginal discharge may be associated with normal physiological changes such as the menstrual cycle or pregnancy. Increased discharge may also occur with the presence or use of foreign substances such as the Intra Uterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD).

Careful history taking should reveal whether a vaginal discharge is abnormal and if it is associated with use of chemical substances e.g. topical self-medication, repeated douching with abrasive substances or indeed due to STI. Changes in the characteristics of a woman's vaginal discharge either in colour, odour, amount and presence of additional

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

symptoms and signs such as soreness and itchiness indicate a need for medical attention.

Abnormal vaginal discharge due to STIs may result in serious pelvic inflammation with sequelae such as ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Careful risk assessment is therefore required (see note below) of women presenting with a vaginal discharge in order to identify the possible causes and provide appropriate treatment regimens based on the most likely aetiology of the vaginal discharge. Factors that must also be considered when selecting treatment for patients include pregnancy status and patient discomfort.

Additionally, the syndromic approach must be used to assess the patient, identify risk factors and treat the likely cause of infection.

Acute lower abdominal pain in a woman may have several causes. These include Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), ruptured ectopic pregnancy and septic abortion. The latter two are surgical emergencies, which require extreme urgency in their management (See sections on 'Ectopic Pregnancy' and 'Abortions').

PID is caused by organisms which may be Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)-related or other bacteria that ascend from the lower genital tract and produce inflammation of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other structures in the pelvis. However, after excluding ectopic pregnancy, STI-related organisms are the most likely cause of lower abdominal pain in a sexually active woman who has not recently delivered a baby, or has no past or recent history of uterine instrumentation.

The presence of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) favours the development of PID particularly in the month following insertion.

Primary infertility is said to occur when a couple has never achieved a pregnancy despite at least one year of uninterrupted and adequate unprotected sexual intercourse. Secondary infertility implies that there has been a previous pregnancy. It is often necessary to evaluate both partners simultaneously and to elicit sexual, menstrual and obstetric history, a past history of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), contraception use and other significant past medical history.

Menopause refers to the point in time when permanent cessation of menstruation occurs due to loss of ovarian function. The cessation of menses is preceded by a peri-menopausal phase during which there may be menstrual irregularity. The age at onset is usually between 45 and 55 years. A woman is considered to be menopausal if there has not been menstruation for a period of at least 12 months in the absence of pregnancy. Menopause may be associated with physical, emotional, and psychological upheaval of varying intensity in some women. Sixty percent of menopausal women however have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. The risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease increase after the menopause.

Carcinoma of the cervix is the commonest form of female genital cancer seen in Ghana. While the disease is preventable, in Ghana, the absence of an effective screening system has resulted in most cases presenting late with advanced disease. In developed countries, the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen considerably due to regular screening procedures (e.g. Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid, Human Papilloma Virus \[HPV\] test).

Vaccination against cancer-causing HPV infection is the ideal method for primary prevention of cervical cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer requires the services of a gynaecological oncologist and radiotherapist. Treatment includes surgery and/or radiation and/or chemotherapy. Surgery involves removal of the central tumour as well as the lymphatics draining the area (Wertheim's hysterectomy). This extensive surgery should be carried out only by trained specialists. Radiation treatment often involves localized pelvic irradiation.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a term that has now replaced the term Acute Renal Failure (ARF). It describes a sudden decrease in renal function occurring over a period of hours to days resulting in accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and disruption of blood volume, electrolyte and acid-base balance.

The differential diagnosis of AKI includes prerenal azotaemia, renal (intrinsic) and post renal (obstructive nephropathy) forms of AKI. The most important risk factor for the development of AKI is the presence of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. Other than good medical care with avoidance of volume contraction, prevention of hypotension and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, no specific interventions have been reliably demonstrated to prevent the development of AKI. During management, a strict fluid input and output chart should be maintained. AKI has been staged by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), AKI working group for severity according to the

criteria below:

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-130 .unnumbered}

All patients with clinical indications for dialysis must be referred promptly to a centre with facilities for dialysis.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) refers to kidney damage of more than 3 months duration. The early stage of CKD is usually asymptomatic but can be detected through laboratory tests of serum creatinine and estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), measurement of urine albumin creatinine ratio and screening of individuals at increased risk such as those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus or a past history of glomerulonephritis.

CKD may manifest either as urine abnormalities (e.g. persistent microalbuminuria, proteinuria, haematuria), blood abnormalities (e.g. elevated urea and creatinine and estimated GFR \< 90 ml/minute/1.73 m2) and structural kidney changes on ultrasonography.

For all stages of CKD, patients should be encouraged to cease smoking, reduce weight if obese, check lipids and treat, and avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic drugs.

Anaemia develops early in the course of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and is nearly universal in patients with CKD stage 5 (End-stage kidney disease). The prevalence of anaemia at higher levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (i.e. CKD stage 1-2) is relatively low in individuals from the general population. Anaemia of CKD is primarily caused by deficiency of erythropoietin. The kidneys are the major source of erythropoietin and, as renal function declines, production of erythropoietin declines proportionately.

Though erythropoietin deficiency is common among patients with anaemia in CKD, other potential causes and contributing disorders should be identified or excluded if initial evaluation yields evidence for disorders other than iron deficiency or erythropoietin deficiency. Correction of anaemia in CKD patients improves survival and quality of life.

## Causes {#causes-124 .unnumbered}

-   Deficiency of erythropoietin

-   Red cell destruction from microvascular disease from diabetes or

> **Chapter 14:** Disorders of the Kidney and Genitourinary System

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the presence of micro-organisms in the urine or tissues of the normally sterile genitourinary tract. Infection may be localized to the bladder alone or the kidneys or, in men the prostate.

Acute uncomplicated UTI occurs in women with a normal genitourinary tract and usually manifests as acute cystitis (bladder infection or lower tract infection). Complicated UTI occurs in individuals with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, including those with indwelling devices such as urethral catheters.

Congenital abnormalities of the genito-urinary tract predispose children to UTI. Proven UTI in a child or recurrent UTI requires further urogenital evaluation.

Definitive treatment of UTI depends on culture and sensitivity reports. However, empirical treatment may be initiated while awaiting the report.

## Causes {#causes-125 .unnumbered}

-   Bacteraemia or septicaemia

-   Urinary tract obstruction e.g. enlarged prostate in adult males, posterior urethral valves in infants/children

## Symptoms {#symptoms-134 .unnumbered}

-   Frequent painful urination

-   Haematuria

-   Cloudy/foul smelling urine

-   Vomiting

-   Suprapubic pain

-   Fever - may be persistent and unexplained (in children)

-   There may be feeding problems, diarrhoea, and failure to thrive as well (in children)

Medicines can lead to renal damage in a number of different ways and examples are given below. In the wrong circumstances life-saving medicines can do more harm than good. Doctors, pharmacists and nurses can help their patients by checking their treatment charts in hospital or at the outpatients department. The medicines listed below may cause renal impairment and must therefore be stopped or not prescribed in patients with deteriorating renal function. All medicines in this table should be dosed based on kidney function (estimated GFR). Avoid concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications and diuretics. Monitor renal function before and during treatment. Patient-related risk factors for all these medicines include age, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, volume depletion, and concurrent use of nephrotoxic medicines.

Acute cystitis is an acute inflammation of the bladder. Women are affected 10 times more than men due to the shortness of their urethra compared to that of men. 40%-50% of all women will develop cystitis in their lifetime.

The ascending faecal-perineal-urethral route is the primary mode of infection. Occasionally sexually transmitted organisms are involved. Risk factors include urethral catheterization and diabetes.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) refers to non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland which results in obstruction of urine flow from the bladder. BPH is the commonest cause of male urinary symptoms in Ghana. The average age at which lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH occurs is about 50 years. Men may seek treatment for LUTS either because the symptoms are bothersome or they feel that it may lead to acute urinary retention or out of fear that it may be an indication of prostate cancer.

It is important to establish what the patient wants from the consultation. In some patients, once reassured that the likelihood of urinary retention and prostate cancer is low, they may not wish treatment

> **Chapter 14:** Disorders of the Kidney and Genitourinary System

for the symptoms.

Currently available medicines can either relax prostatic smooth muscles or cause reduction in the prostate size and therefore ease the symptoms of BPH. A combination of available medications, especially in patients with a prostate size more than 40 ml, produce better responses than monotherapy.

BPH may lead to complications such as recurrent urinary tract infection, acute urine retention with painful distension of the bladder, chronic urine retention with painless gross distension of the bladder, haematuria, and renal failure.

Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland, which may be bacterial or abacterial. Bacterial prostatitis is more common than abacterial prostatitis. It may present as an acute condition which may either be sexually transmitted or result from urethral reflux of infected urine into the prostatic ducts. Other potential sources may be bacteria spread from rectum or bloodstream.

If inadequately treated this may progress to chronic prostatitis. It is more common in men below below 50 years.

This refers to the absence of testis(es) in the scrotum/hemiscrotum. Ten percent of cases are bilateral. Seventy-five percent of full term infants with undescended testes and 90% of premature infants would have spontaneous descent of testes from the intra-abdominal site by the age of one year. Persistent undescent of the testis is associated with an increased

This refers to a spontaneous, prolonged, persistent, usually painful erection, which is unwanted and not associated with sexual desire and not relieved by coitus. Priapism is classified into three types namely: Low-flow or ischaemic (commonest), High-flow (non-ischaemic) and Stuttering Priapism. It is commonly seen as a prolongation of Nocturnal Penile Tumescence (NPT) or early morning erection. This is a well-known complication of sickle cell disease.

Patients are usually shy and reluctant to come to the hospital due to stigmatisation. Late presentation is therefore common and herbal medicine applications and spiritual remedies may have been tried to relieve symptoms prior to being seen in hospital. Early reversal within 24-48 hours may reduce the high impotence complication rate of 50%. Although the occurrence is usually in adults, it may periodically occur in older children.

## Causes {#causes-131 .unnumbered}

-   Idiopathic or unknown in 60% of cases

These valves or folds of tissue are congenital obstructing membranes within the lumen of the urethra. It affects between 1 in 5,000 -- 8,000 males. It is the commonest cause of congenital bladder outlet obstruction. They obstruct urinary outflow from the bladder but permit easy urethral catheterisation. Because the obstruction starts in-utero, secondary changes in the bladder and upper urinary tract are advanced at birth.

Some patients may be born with severe renal impairment or this may develop soon after birth if recognition is delayed. Most patients present as neonates or infants. Occasionally presentation is late in childhood. All

These are crystal-like objects, which form in various parts of the urinary tract. They consist mainly of mineral salts i.e. crystal-forming ions. Some of the common stone-types include calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, magnesium ammonium phosphate and uric acid. Some risk factors in developing stones include crystalluria, affluence, diet, occupation, climate (dehydration), family history and medications. Majority of stones less than 5 mm in diameter will pass spontaneously.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-141 .unnumbered}

Refer to a urologist or surgical specialist for definitive treatment after initial management.

This refers to a narrowing or complete obstruction of the urethral lumen due to fibrosis (scarring). It is the second commonest cause of retention of urine in Ghana and the most common in young males usually resulting from previous inadequately treated STI. The commonest site is the anterior urethra i.e. bulbar and penile urethra in males. It may be complicated by periurethral abscess, superficial extravasation of urine and urethrocutaneous fistulae, retention of urine and post-renal renal failure.

## Causes {#causes-134 .unnumbered}

-   Gonococcal or non-gonococcal urethritis

-   External trauma e.g. road traffic injuries, falls, straddle or astride injury and pelvic fractures

-   Iatrogenic: Urethral instrumentation e.g. catheterisation, endoscopy

-   Postoperative e.g. prostatectomy

-   Congenital strictures (rare)

## Symptoms {#symptoms-141 .unnumbered}

-   Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) e.g. poor urinary stream, split or splayed stream, reduced caliber of stream improved by straining, frequency and dysuria, post-void dribbling, incomplete emptying of bladder

-   Urinary (overflow) incontinence

-   Urinary retention (acute or chronic)

## Signs {#signs-138 .unnumbered}

-   There may be none in uncomplicated cases

-   Palpable induration of urethra

-   Periurethral abscesses

-   Extravasation of urine into scrotum and superficial tissue

-   Urethrocutaneous fistulas/watering-can scrotum

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

-   Bladder may be palpable if there is retention

-   Kidney may be palpable in hydronephrosess

-   Localized induration may be felt along the urethra

-   Failure of catheterisation - this heightens the suspicion of a stricture

## Investigations {#investigations-146 .unnumbered}

-   Urinalysis

-   Urine culture and sensitivity

-   Blood urea, electrolytes and creatinine

-   Ultrasound Scan of kidneys, bladder, postvoid residual urine and spongiofibrosis

> provided a suprapubic catheter is in place

-   Uroflowmetry

-   Urethrocystoscopy

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-113 .unnumbered}

-   To relieve symptoms and prevent complication

-   To treat underlying cause

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-145 .unnumbered}

-   Try catheterisation - a gentle attempt is made to pass a urethral catheter, which will be held up, at the site of stricture in patients who present with retention of urine. Confirmation of site of obstruction is still needed by urethrography or urethroscopy.

-   If catherization fails and patient is in acute retention

-   Suprapubic cystostomy or suprapubic needle puncture and aspiration (try this procedure if facilities for suprapubic cystostomy are lacking). Aspirate as much urine as possible to decompress the bladder and relieve pain before referral

-   Definitive treatment is surgical. In most cases referral to a specialist centre will be necessary

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-134 .unnumbered}

-   None except for Urinary Tract Infection (See appropriate section)

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-142 .unnumbered}

Refer to specialist for further investigations prior to definitive treatment.

Vasectomy is a permanent male contraceptive method, which is a simple, short and safe surgical procedure. It is carried out by trained surgeons usually under local anaesthesia after careful counselling and informed consent.

> **Chapter 14:** Disorders of the Kidney and Genitourinary System

Vasectomy is the most effective male family planning method. Involving males in issues of reproductive health and family planning has several benefits with a positive impact on society.

Vasectomy should be encouraged for appropriate clients. It is less invasive and simpler than female sterilisation. Reversal of vasectomy is a difficult surgery using loupes/microscope with success rate of 60-80% if done in less than 3 years after vasectomy.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-143 .unnumbered}

Clients should be referred to a Family Planning Unit or Urologist for the procedure.

surgery saves the testes.

Delay in treatment could result in testicular atrophy, abnormal sperm count leading to infertility/sterility.

It can be classified into intravaginal torsion, which constitute more than 95% and extra-vaginal torsion, which is usually found in infants. About 50% of torsion occurs during sleep and early in the morning. It is rare in older children and adults but common in children under 15 years.

## Advanced Disease

-   Chemotherapeutic agents recommended for advanced stage include Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Adriamycin and Cisplatin.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-147 .unnumbered}

Refer all cases of bladder cancer for specialist evaluation and treatment. All cases of chronic cystitis should be referred to specialist to exclude bladder cancer.

Ninety-five per cent of these tumours are adenocarcinomas. The majority of men affected are aged between 65 and 85 years. The incidence increases with age. It is recommended that every male, 40 years and above, should have annual screening by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) tests and Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) since early detection is associated with better prognosis. The benefit or otherwise of screening should be discussed with patients.

Patients with a family history of prostate cancer and should consider annual screening from 40 years and above with PSA and DRE. It is worth noting that not every hard prostate on DRE is malignant. Likewise a normal-feeling prostate does not exclude a malignancy. A prostatic biopsy is therefore necessary to establish a diagnosis.

It means the persistent inability of a man to achieve an erection, which is adequate in terms of hardness and duration for satisfactory sexual intercourse. So long as a man can achieve a hard enough erection to permit vaginal penetration, with a long enough "staying power" to perform the sexual act till ejaculation is attained, he is judged to be potent. The number of "rounds" per session is irrelevant.

The condition may be classified as organic, psychogenic or mixed in terms of aetiology; primary (never been able to attain and/or maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual intercourse) or secondary, where impotence occurs in men who have previously had a satisfactory sexual performance.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-149 .unnumbered}

Referral to a specialist centre is necessary for proper evaluation and management in most cases.

Infertility is the failure of a couple to achieve conception within 12 months of adequate unprotected coitus. About one third of cases of infertility result from pathologic factors in men, one third from factors in both men and women and one third from factors in females. Male causes therefore account for 50% of infertility. About 15% of all married couples experience reproductive difficulties. Components of infertility history include medical, surgical, fertility, sexual, family, medication, social and occupational history.

## Causes {#causes-141 .unnumbered}

For practical purposes the main causes can be divided into three:

-   Treatable causes

-   Potentially treatable causes

-   Untreatable causes

The causes can also be classified under three categories: Pre- testicular, Testicular and Post-testicular.

This is the passage of blood in the urine. It may be microscopic or macroscopic, intermittent or continuous. The pattern of blood in the urine may be initial, terminal or frank/total. Blood in urine is a serious symptom and must always be fully investigated especially to exclude cancer. Certain drugs and food products may colour urine red resulting in false haematuria and these should be differentiated from true haematuria, which is detected by microscopic examination of the urine. Examples of such substances are rifampicin and rhodamine B food colouring used in cakes, cookies and soft drinks. Occasionally vaginal bleeding may be mistaken for haematuria.

Definitive treatment depends on the cause.

This is a water-borne disease caused by penetration of the skin or mucous membranes by the early stages of the causative organism (*Schistosoma haematobium*), which in the adult form settles in the blood vessels of the urinary bladder resulting in the common presentation of haematuria.

This disease is common in Ghana with several endemic areas along the lakes, slow-flowing rivers and irrigation systems. The commonest body sites affected are the bladder, ureters and pelvic organs. Prevention entails avoiding contact with infested water.

Chronic infestation may lead to severe anaemia, ureteric stricture and hydronephrosis as well as carcinoma of the bladder.

(See section on 'STI-related persistent or recurrent urethral discharge').

Retention of urine is inability to empty a full bladder. It is the commonest urological emergency in Ghana and worldwide. Adult males are more commonly affected. It is rare in children and in females. The causes differ in different age groups as well as in males and females. A family history of retention of urine in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer are risk factors.

Retention of urine can be classified into three:

1.  Acute retention of Urine is of sudden onset with a palpable tender bladder.

2.  Chronic Retention of Urine is of insidious onset and presents with a palpable non-tender bladder and overflow incontinence resulting in more damage to the bladder, ureters and kidneys. Post-renal renal failure may complicate this type of retention with hydronephroses and hydroureters.

3.  Acute-on-chronic retention of urine is when a chronic retention of urine is suddenly complicated by acute retention of urine.

# Chapter {#chapter-15 .unnumbered}

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) result in several clinical syndromes caused by organisms that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity.

They cause acute morbidity in adults and may result in long-term complications such as urethral stricture, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, anal fistula, cervical cancer, foetal wastage, prematurity, low birth weight, ophthalmia neonatorum and congenital syphilis. Their control is the cornerstone in improving reproductive health and reducing Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections.

Comprehensive management of STI is important and comprises prompt and effective case detection and treatment. However, owing to the lack of laboratory equipment and manpower in primary care facilities where most patients first present, an accurate diagnosis is often not possible. Also with most STIs, one cannot usually tell which organism is causing the infection from the history and physical examination alone. Multiple infections also occur, with each needing to be treated. Failure to treat one infection adequately may result in the development of serious complications.

It is therefore more practical in managing STIs to base treatment on a 'syndromic diagnosis', which identifies all STIs that could cause a particular symptom or sign and provide treatment for each of them simultaneously. The common clinical syndromes associated with STIs include urethral discharge in males, persistent/recurrent urethral discharge, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, genital ulcer, scrotal swellings, inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes), ano-rectal syndromes (ano-rectal discharge, ulcers and vesicles), and genital warts. Scabies and pediculosis

pubis may also be transmitted by sexual contact.

In dealing with patients with STI, privacy and confidentiality, especially with the history taking and examination, are paramount.

Education and counselling of STI patients and concurrent management of their partners provide additional opportunities to reduce the risk of STI in the community.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-154 .unnumbered}

Refer all cases of treatment failure to a health facility where microbiological culture and antimicrobial sensitivity tests can be done on the urethral discharge.

While a vaginal discharge is a notable clinical feature of an STI, not all forms of vaginal discharge are abnormal or indicative of an STI. A vaginal discharge may be associated with a physiological state such as menses or pregnancy, or with the presence or use of foreign substances and chemicals in the vagina.

A careful risk assessment (See note below) of women with a vaginal discharge may help identify STIs and non-STIs and selection of appropriate treatment regimens based on the most likely aetiology of the vaginal discharge. Other considerations for selecting treatment include pregnancy status and patient discomfort.

## Causes {#causes-146 .unnumbered}

-   *Neisseria gonorrhoea*

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-156 .unnumbered}

If the symptoms or lesions do not improve after treatment refer to a health facility with microbiology support for appropriate treatment and exclusion of other causes to exclude other causes.

Neonates, pre-pubertal and pubertal children are also at risk of contracting STIs. The modes of transmission in these children are mostly through maternal infections, sexual abuse or exploitation and voluntary sexual activity in older children. The STls in this age group include neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum), and other STI-related syndromes similar to that in adults.

Some of these STls (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia), if acquired after the neonatal period, are indicative of sexual contact. For other STls, (e.g. HPV infections and vaginitis), the association with sexual contact is not clear.

# Chapter {#chapter-16 .unnumbered}

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a late stage of infection with the Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV). It can affect both adults and children often predisposing them to opportunistic infections and certain malignancies. Co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) and Hepatitis B are particularly frequent in HIV infected individuals and must be screened for in all cases.

The main risk factors for HIV/AIDS remain transmission by exchange of body fluids and blood products through sexual contact, transfusion, needle-stick injury, non-sterile surgical practices and mother to child transfer.

HIV infection is currently not curable. However, for persons living with HIV infection (PLHIV), effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is available country-wide at accredited centres at the regional and district level in both public and private health care facilities to which all diagnosed patients must be referred.

Prevention of infection remains the key to reducing its spread.

> **Referral criteria**

Refer all HIV positive patients to an accredited treatment centre in Ghana.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is short-term antiretroviral treatment to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure by preventing the establishment of infection or preventing new infection. PEP reduces staff exposure to HIV infections at work and also clears possible HIV infection from infected dendritic cells. Workplace accidents or injury expose health workers to body fluids of patients. Risk of exposure to blood and blood borne pathogens is slightly higher for healthcare personnel. The risk of infection for HIV from a percutaneous injury is approximately 0-3% and that of mucous membranes or non- intact skin are much lower. PEP is particularly effective within 1-2 hours and not more than 72 hours after exposure.

## Causes {#causes-154 .unnumbered}

-   An exposure considered as possible risk is defined as "an exposure from possibly infected blood, tissue or other body fluids through:

    -   A percutaneous injury (e.g. a needle stick or cut with a sharp object) or

    -   A mucocutaneous membrane or non-intact (chapped, abraded skin) contact

-   The risk of infection appears to be higher after:

# Chapter {#chapter-17 .unnumbered}

Fever is a common complaint, which is usually related to an infection of viral, bacterial or parasitic origin. It may be a valuable guide to the diagnosis and severity of infections.

Fever is defined as an axillary temperature above 37.5 °C (read after keeping the thermometer in place for 3 minutes). Fever above 38 °C in children and adults often needs urgent attention, especially if the patient is restless or delirious. Not every fever is due to malaria or typhoid. Every fever should be investigated and treated appropriately. A thorough history, physical examination and appropriate investigation would usually reveal the cause of the fever.

In neonates and the elderly, severe infections may not be accompanied by a fever. In infants and young children, fever may be associated with convulsions, collapse or coma. (See table below for possible differential diagnoses and appropriate action)

## Causes {#causes-155 .unnumbered}

-   Viral infection

-   Bacterial infection

-   Fungal infections

-   Parasitic infestations

-   Haematological malignancies e.g. lymphoma, leukaemia

-   Connective tissue disease

-   Medicine-related

## Symptoms {#symptoms-161 .unnumbered}

-   Chills, rigors

-   Body aches

## Signs {#signs-159 .unnumbered}

-   Temperature \> 37.5 oC

-   Evidence of dehydration e.g. sunken eyes

-   Evidence of underlying conditions (refer guidelines below)

-   Tachypnoea

-   Tachycardia

> **Chapter 18:** Infectious Diseases and Infestations

## Investigations {#investigations-165 .unnumbered}

-   FBC

-   Blood film for malaria parasites

-   Rapid diagnostic test for malaria

-   Cultures of urine, blood, sputum, ear discharge, throat swab, wound swab, cerebrospinal fluid depending on presentation

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-126 .unnumbered}

-   To reduce body temperature to normal

-   To relieve symptoms

-   To identify and treat the underlying cause of the fever (see guidelines below)

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-166 .unnumbered}

-   Keep the patient well hydrated with fluids e.g. water, fruit juices, light porridge, "rice-water" or coconut milk

-   Maintain nutrition, continue breast-feeding in babies

-   Tepid sponge the child. (Wet a towel with lukewarm water and apply to the body starting from the extremities and gradually work your way upwards to the head. Leave a film of water on the body to dry on the skin. Repeat the process as often as needed)

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-156 .unnumbered}

Evidence Rating: \[A\]

-   Paracetamol, oral,

[Adults]{.underline}

1 g 6-8 hourly

[Children]{.underline}

10-15 mg/kg/dose. May repeat dose 6-8 hourly as necessary

Tuberculosis (TB) may affect any part of the body, but the commonest site is the lung (Pulmonary TB). Other sites affected include the spine, bone and joints, brain, urinary tract, abdomen and lymph nodes etc. Pulmonary TB patients who have acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in their sputum (bacteriologically positive TB) are most infectious and spread the disease through airborne droplets when they cough, spit or sneeze. Drinking unpasteurized milk may cause bovine TB, which manifests as abdominal TB. Persons with lowered resistance to infection, such as HIV/AIDS and diabetes, are especially at risk of developing TB. Such individuals tend not to have the typical symptoms and signs of TB. They may have features such as fever, weight loss and diarrhoea, which could also be attributed to the condition.

In children with severe malnutrition who show poor response to dietary treatment, TB must be considered and excluded.

B.  Adjunctive treatment

-   Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), oral,

[Adults]{.underline}

50-100 mg daily for 3- 8 months

[Children]{.underline}

25-50 mg daily for 8 months

## And {#and-214 .unnumbered}

-   Prednisolone, oral, (in cases of TB meningitis and TB pericarditis)

[Adults]{.underline}

40-60 mg daily, 2-4 weeks then taper off on improvement over 2-4 weeks and discontinue

[Children]{.underline}

1-2 mg/kg daily, 2-4 weeks then taper off on improvement over 2-4 weeks and discontinue

## Treatment in Special Situations

[Chronic kidney disease]{.underline}

New cases (Adults and children)

Owing to a high risk of uveitis, give the following

-   Intensive phase - HRZ for 2 months

-   Continuation phase - HR for 4 months

[Pregnancy and breastfeeding]{.underline}

-   Give standard treatment.

-   Do not use streptomycin (ototoxic to foetus)

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) must be presumed (suspected) in persons who remain bacteriologically positive (either smear positive, culture positive or Gene Xpert positive) after intensive phase of standard first-line TB treatment with or without clinical improvement. Persons who test rifampicin resistance positive at initial diagnosis with Gene Xpert must also be treated as cases of DR-TB. These persons must be further evaluated using TB culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) or newer molecular diagnostic tests such as Line Probe Assays (LPA).

Persons at high risk of drug resistance are TB patients failing Category I+III or Category II treatment, contacts of confirmed DR-TB patients and TB/HIV co-infected patients not improving on treatment.

Persons at medium risk of drug resistance are relapsed TB patients, return after lost-to-follow up and health care workers newly diagnosed with TB. Patients are classified according to the pattern of documented drug resistance profile.

The drug regimen for treatment is selected based on the following

principles:

-   History of drugs used to treat TB patients, profile of drug resistance in Ghana and/or DST profile of the patient

-   A minimum of four new core medicines that are known to be effective

-   Kanamycin/Capreomycin an injectable medicine, is the backbone of the four core medicines and should be used in the intensive phase

-   An effective fluoroquinolone should be used due to the extensive use of earlier generation fluoroquinolones

-   May include a first line drug to which the strain is susceptible.

-   Cross-resistance may occur between drugs of the same group and this is taken into consideration.

-   Drugs are administered daily under strict DOT throughout the injectable and continuation phases.

Treatment of Multi Drug Resistant-TB (MDR-TB) and Rifampicin Resistant-TB (RR-TB) patients is prioritised. Treatment duration is 20-24

> **Chapter 18:** Infectious Diseases and Infestations

months and is determined by sputum smear and culture (bacteriological) conversion (Treatment lasts 16-18 months after bacteriological conversion). Progression from initial to continuation phase is dependent on at least four (4) consecutive months of negative sputum cultures.

Community-based care is promoted in Ghana over facility-based care except in situations requiring admission for management of complications. The practice of infection prevention and control should be maintained at all times during treatment of these patients.

Treatment adherence is critical in the treatment of DR-TB due to limited number of available, effective medicines. Treatment is challenging due to long duration, drug toxicities and side effects. Clinical teams must use a patient-centred care approach and support patients throughout treatment until cured. Psychosocial and economic support is required from treatment supporters, patient families and clinical teams throughout treatment. Early detection and prompt management of drug side effects ensures successful outcomes.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-159 .unnumbered}

Refer all patients to a DOTS treatment centre for management and monitoring under Ghana National Tuberculosis Programme.

Typhoid fever (enteric fever) is a severe bacterial illness, which occurs where sanitary conditions are poor permitting contamination of food or water with faeces. The bacteria which are spread by the faeco-oral route invade the intestinal wall and spread through the bloodstream to all organs. They are passed into the stool and urine of infected patients. Organisms may continue to be present in the stool of healthy carriers, i.e.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

patients with positive stool cultures, 12 months after treatment or those with long-term subclinical disease.

If improperly treated typhoid fever may result in complications such as intestinal perforation with peritonitis, bloody stools, acute psychosis and severe intravascular haemolysis leading to acute kidney injury (especially in G6PD deficiency).

Public education on good personal hygiene, hand washing and appropriate disposal of solid waste would often prevent the disease. Screening of food handlers by carrying out stool cultures to exclude carrier status and safe handling of food, fruits and vegetables are also helpful preventive measures.

## Causes {#causes-157 .unnumbered}

-   *Salmonella typhi* and paratyphi

## Symptoms {#symptoms-162 .unnumbered}

-   Fever which increases gradually to a high fever and persists for weeks (fever does not respond to antimalarials)

-   Constipation in the early stages

-   Abdominal pain and diarrhoea in the second week of illness

-   Severe headache

-   Dry cough

-   Psychosis and confusion may occur

## Signs {#signs-161 .unnumbered}

-   High fever with a relatively slow pulse rate (occasionally pulse is fast especially with myocarditis or intestinal perforation)

-   Abdominal tenderness

-   Hepato-splenomegaly (tender)

-   Confusion

-   Signs of chest infection (pneumonitis)

## Investigations {#investigations-167 .unnumbered}

-   FBC, differential,

-   RDT / blood film for malaria parasite (to exclude malaria)

-   Blood culture

-   Stool culture

-   Urine culture

## Treatment {#treatment-22 .unnumbered}

> **Chapter 18:** Infectious Diseases and Infestations

## Treatment objectives {#treatment-objectives-15 .unnumbered}

-   To eradicate the infection

-   To detect and manage complications

-   To prevent transmission of infection to other people

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-168 .unnumbered}

-   Tepid sponging to reduce body temperature if required

## Pharmacological treatment {#pharmacological-treatment-158 .unnumbered}

Malaria is a very common infection in Ghana. It follows the introduction of protozoan malaria parasites into the bloodstream by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Malaria is a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality especially among vulnerable individuals, such as children under 5 years of age, pregnant women (sometimes with adverse foetal and maternal outcomes), patients with sickle cell disease and visiting non-resident Ghanaians and expatriates.

Based on the clinical severity, cases of malaria are categorized as either 'uncomplicated' or 'severe'. A diagnosis of malaria can be suspected based on the patient's symptoms and the physical findings at examination. However, for a definitive diagnosis to be made laboratory tests (blood film and/or Rapid Diagnostic Test) must demonstrate the malaria parasites or their components since the clinical presentation of the condition can be similar to other common diseases such as typhoid fever, urinary tract infection, septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis in both adults and children and measles, otitis media, tonsillitis, etc. in children.

In Ghana, diagnosis is progressively being shifted from clinical to laboratory confirmation as the basis for treatment. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) may be used to confirm a diagnosis if microscopy (blood film) is not available.

Preventive measures in the community mainly target elimination of the insect vector or prevention of mosquito bites while additional chemoprophylaxis is required for vulnerable individuals.

The development of resistance of malaria parasites to anti-malarial medications is a matter of major public health concern. This phenomenon is largely the result of 'over-diagnosis' and wrong diagnosis of malaria by healthcare practitioners and patients alike, with its attendant over- treatment and sometimes partial or incomplete treatment, leading to over-exposure of the parasites to the anti-malarial drug (drug pressure). Additionally, Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT), rather than monotherapy with artemisinin derivatives, is currently recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria to prevent the development of drug resistance.

It is therefore necessary to obtain laboratory confirmation of a diagnosis of malaria before starting treatment. Exceptions to this principle are children under 5 years and cases of suspected severe malaria where laboratory confirmation is not immediately possible. In such circumstances, a complete course of the appropriate anti-malarial medication(s) must be given.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

Severe or 'complicated malaria' can arise from delay in diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of uncomplicated malaria. It mostly occurs in children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and non-immune individuals. The events causing most deaths in severe malaria are related to cerebral involvement (cerebral malaria), severe anaemia, hypoglycaemia, severe dehydration, renal failure and respiratory acidosis. The diagnosis of severe malaria is based on clinical features and confirmed with laboratory testing. Not all cases of severe malaria have high parasitaemia and initial blood film examination may be negative.

Where the diagnosis is suspected, treatment must be started without delay while awaiting confirmation.

## Symptoms {#symptoms-164 .unnumbered}

-   Poor oral intake (e.g. breast milk in children)

-   Repeated profuse vomiting

-   Dark or 'cola-coloured' urine

-   Passing of very little urine

-   Difficulty in breathing

-   Generalised weakness, inability to walk or sit without assistance

-   Altered consciousness (change of behaviour, confusion, delirium, coma)

-   Repeated generalized convulsions

## Signs {#signs-163 .unnumbered}

-   Hyperpyrexia (axillary temperature \> 38.5°C)

-   Extreme pallor (severe anaemia; Hb \< 5 g/dl)

-   Marked jaundice

-   Circulatory collapse or shock (cold limbs, weak rapid pulse)

-   Tachypnoea (Rapid breathing)

-   Crepitations on chest examination

-   Sweating (due to hypoglycaemia)

-   Haemoglobinuria (dark or 'cola-coloured' urine)

-   Oliguria

-   Spontaneous unexplained heavy bleeding (disseminated intravascular coagulation)

-   Altered consciousness (change of behaviour, confusion, delirium, coma)

## Investigations {#investigations-169 .unnumbered}

-   Rapid diagnostic test

-   Blood film for malaria parasites - thick and thin blood films (should be done where available)

-   FBC

-   Sickling test

> **Chapter 18:** Infectious Diseases and Infestations

-   Random blood glucose

-   BUE and creatinine

-   Blood grouping and cross-matching

-   Lumbar puncture in the convulsing or comatose patient to exclude meningitis or encephalitis

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-128 .unnumbered}

> The dosage for IM Quinine is 10 mg (0.2 ml) per kg of bodyweight every 8 hours.

> **How to give Intramuscular Quinine Intramuscular Quinine in Young Children:**

-   Weigh the child

-   Prepare a Quinine dilution of 50 mg/ml: Use a 10 ml sterile syringe and needle to draw up 5 mls of sterile water for injection or saline (not dextrose). Then into the same syringe draw up 300 mg (1ml) from an ampoule of Qui- nine. The syringe now contains 50 mg Quinine per ml.

-   The dosage is 10 mg (0.2 ml) per kg or body weight every 8 hours. Calculate the volume to give based on body weight. (For examples of body weights and doses in children \< 30 kg, sArtesunate, rectal, 10 mg/kg (preferred in children under 6 years;110).

-   Administer by intramuscular injection to the thigh. If the diluted volume ex- ceeds 3 ml, inject half the dose into each thigh.

> **Intramuscular Quinine in Adults:**

-   Use a Quinine dilution of 100 mg/ml. To prepare this, draw 2 mls of Quinine 600 mg and add 4 mls of sterile water or saline (not dextrose)

-   The dosage is 10 mg/kg body weight of Quinine given 8 hourly by deep IM injection, to a maximum dose of 600 mg

-   Small adults (weighing less than 60 kg) should be weighed to calculate the correct dose. Larger adults will simply receive the maximum dose (600 mg)

-   If the required volume is more than 5 ml, divide it into two and inject at

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-161 .unnumbered}

Patients diagnosed as having severe malaria or who fail to respond to the recommended antimalarial medications must be referred. Appropriate treatment as indicated above must be initiated prior to transferring the patient. If referral is not possible immediately, continue the treatment regimen as shown above for severe malaria until referral is possible.

Pregnancy makes women more likely to get malaria or die from malaria. Malaria infection is more severe during pregnancy while pregnancy and its outcomes can become complicated by it. The effects of malaria on the pregnant mother include a severe form of the illness, anaemia, miscarriage, pre-term labour, and post-partum haemorrhage. Risks to the foetus include foetal anaemia, pre-maturity, intra-uterine growth restriction, low birth weight, stillbirth, congenital malaria, and increased perinatal mortality. Preventive measures must be emphasised (i.e. Insecticide-treated Nets \[ITNs\] and Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy \[IPTp\] under direct observation) while confirmed cases must be treated promptly.

## E. Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp) {#e.-intermittent-preventive-treatment-in-pregnancy-iptp .unnumbered}

IPTp consists of giving the fixed-dose combination medication Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) in treatment doses at predefined intervals after quickening (16 gestational weeks). Current recommendation is that IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) be given to all pregnant women at each scheduled antenatal care visit except during the first trimester. WHO recommends a schedule of four focused antenatal care visits for normal pregnancy. In Ghana, the national malaria control strategy reserves SP for the purpose of intermittent preventive treatment only.

To prevent the development of drug resistance, SP is not to be used for other purposes such as treatment of acute attacks of malaria.

This is the intermittent administration of full treatment courses using the recommended anti-malarial medicine during peak malaria transmission seasons to prevent malaria illness. A complete treatment course is given to children aged between 3 and 59 months at monthly intervals to a maximum of 4 doses during the malaria transmission season. In Ghana, SMC has been implemented in the Northern Savannah using Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine and Amodiaquine (SP + AQ)

This is an infection of the coverings of the brain, and is most commonly caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. One type, Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM), caused by *Neisseria meningitides*, is common in the Northern and Upper Regions of Ghana, and usually occurs in epidemics during the harmattan season. The presentation may sometimes be confused with cerebral malaria. Meningitis is a medical emergency. Failure to recognise and adequately manage meningitis results in serious complications.

Inform regional or district health authorities immediately in epidemic meningitis.

It is important to prevent this condition by examining the eyes of all sick and malnourished children. The diet of children should include foods that contain Vitamin A (dark green leafy vegetables e.g. nkontomire, yellow fruits and vegetables, palm oil, milk, eggs).

Parents and other caregivers should be discouraged from putting any traditional preparations such as herbs, sea water, saliva, urine, etc. or drugs into the eye unless prescribed by a physician.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-164 .unnumbered}

Refer all established cases of xerophthalmia to an eye specialist if the condition is severe with an uneven or bulging cornea.

Foreign bodies refer to specks of dust, small insects or other tiny objects that get into the eyes. The foreign body may be either in the conjunctival sac, on the cornea or inside the eyeball (intraocular). A history of the likely nature of the foreign body aids in its detection and removal. The foreign body may be seen by careful inspection of the cornea or conjunctival sac. Adequate lighting is needed to detect corneal foreign bodies.

## Causes {#causes-162 .unnumbered}

-   Specks of dust

-   Small insects

-   Ferrous metallic specs (such as occurs with metal grinders)

-   Other tiny objects

## Symptoms {#symptoms-168 .unnumbered}

-   Feeling of something in the eye which may be irritating

-   Sudden discomfort or severe pain

-   Watering of the eye

-   Red eye(s)

-   Tearing of the eyes

-   Photophobia

-   Chemosis

-   Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage

-   Irregular pupil in penetrating eye injury with retained intraocular foreign body

-   Blood in the anterior chamber (hyphaema)

## Investigations {#investigations-173 .unnumbered}

-   X-ray of the orbit (suspected metallic foreign body)

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-131 .unnumbered}

-   To remove superficial foreign bodies

-   To treat associated injury

-   To prevent complications

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-174 .unnumbered}

-   Where the foreign body is under the upper eyelid, evert the eyelid and remove the foreign body.

-   If the foreign body cannot be removed, apply topical antibiotic, pad the eye and REFER to an eye specialist clinic.

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-165 .unnumbered}

Refer patients with corneal foreign bodies, intraocular foreign bodies, persistent pain and redness of the eye to the eye specialist.

Red eyes are either the result of inflammation of ocular tissue or bleeding into the sub conjunctival space. The pattern of the redness, nature of the discharge, associated pain and its intensity, vision loss and appearance of the cornea are helpful in characterising the red eye. Red eye is a potentially very serious condition especially in situations where the redness is around the cornea.

## Causes {#causes-163 .unnumbered}

-   Conjunctivitis

-   Corneal ulcer or keratitis

-   Acute anterior uveitis (inflammation of the uveal tract)

-   Acute angle closure glaucoma

-   Episcleritis

-   Scleritis

-   Subconjunctival haemorrhage

Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy usually but not always associated with raised intraocular pressure. It is the second leading cause of preventable blindness in the world. Chronic Glaucoma may produce severe loss of vision and blindness without prior warning symptoms and must therefore be screened for in all adults beyond the age of 40 years. Acute glaucoma is however associated with very high intraocular pressures and very severe pain and inflammation of the eye and can lead to blindness quickly if not treated. When congenital, glaucoma causes enlargement of the eyeball associated with increased sensitivity to light and watering.

Pharmacological treatment may vary from patient to patient according to local availability, affordability, and individual response to treatment.

## Causes {#causes-164 .unnumbered}

-   Acute closure of the drainage angle (due to pupil block in primary angle closure glaucoma)

-   Inadequate drainage of aqueous from the anterior chamber (despite open drainage angles in chronic open angle glaucoma)

-   Neovascular membrane in the drainage angle in ischaemic eye diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy

-   Displaced lens in secondary angle closure glaucoma

-   Malformation of the drainage angle in congenital glaucoma

Strabismus is misalignment usually of one eye preventing simultaneous viewing of an object by both eyes. Onset in children under 7 years interferes with the development of the visual system of the deviating eye in the brain leading to amblyopia. Acute onset at an older age causes double vision. Diplopia does not occur in children because of the ability to suppress the second image or development of amblyopia. Amblyopia does not occur if the deviation alternated from one eye to the other. The more frequent types are horizontal misalignment. Esotropia is convergent deviation and exotropia is divergent deviation.

-   Congenital misalignment

-   Acquired deviation

-   Paralysis of the cranial nerve VI, III or IV

# Chapter {#chapter-19 .unnumbered}

Stridor is an emergency condition. It has a characteristic noise in the inspiratory phase of breathing. This occurs when there is an obstruction of the upper airway from the nasopharnyx down to the trachea and main bronchi. The obstruction is usually in the subglottic area.

It is commonly a viral illness, and may be preceded usually by the common cold. Measles may also be complicated by Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB). Two important causes of stridor in children are viral croup (LTB) and acute epiglottitis.

In the management of stridor, steroids are most useful when given within 6 hours of onset of symptoms. Cough syrups containing opiates and atropine are contraindicated.

Refer cases with severe obstruction and complications in children to a Paediatrician or ENT specialist. Also refer all cases of stridor if there is no expertise to intubate or perform tracheostomy to a specialist.

This is an acute and life-threatening infection in which the epiglottis and surrounding tissue become acutely inflamed and oedematous causing severe obstruction of the upper airways. The disease tends to run an extremely rapid course (4-6 hours) to respiratory failure and death.

It is more common in children. However, the incidence has reduced significantly due to the current immunisation schedule with the pentavalent vaccine.

Examination of the throat in patients with this condition must be done only in the presence of a doctor capable and ready to intubate.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-175 .unnumbered}

Refer all cases to the ENT specialist.

This is an infection of the throat and tonsils. Most sore throats are due to viral infections and should NOT be treated with antibiotics as they subside within 3 to 5 days. However, it is important to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis since it may give rise to abscesses in the throat (retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscess) as well as complications that involve organs like the kidneys and the heart. Streptococcal throat infections require treatment with antibiotics in order to reduce the complications noted above.

It is a spreading infection originating usually from a molar tooth into the fascial spaces of the sub-lingual, sub-mandibular and para-pharynx. This happens when a periapical abscess erodes through the lingual cortical plate of the mandible and gains access to these neck fascial spaces. The infection can then track down and enter the thorax. Another source of infection is the tonsillar crypt abscess. The initial presentation with swelling of the floor of the mouth and spread, with upper neck involvement is termed Ludwig's angina. As it spreads down the neck, the term cervico-facial abscess is used. This condition is an emergency and must be treated as such.

Mouth ulcers are generally due to infection (bacterial, viral or fungal), neutropaenia, malignancy-related or trauma. The common ones are apthous and viral ulcers.

APTHOUS ULCERS

Apthous ulcer is a recurrent ulcer of non-viral origin that occurs on the movable surfaces of the oral cavity. Size is variable but may have a rim of erythema with yellowish base, and later becoming a greyish hue. They are classified into minor, major or herpetiform on clinical presentation. The minor is \< 1 cm, and the major 1-3 cm in diameter. The herpetiform comes in multiple crops of 1-3 cm. Though the cause is unknown, systemic conditions associated with apthous ulcer include Behcet's syndrome, HIV, Vitamin deficiency states (vitamin B group, folic acid).

Herpetiform ulcers are a crop of oral apthous ulcers resembling oral viral ulcers.

Behcet's disease is a more severe and generalised form involving the eye, skin and genitalia.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown cause. An external trigger (e.g. cigarette smoking, infection, or trauma) triggers an autoimmune reaction, leading to synovial hypertrophy and chronic joint inflammation along with the prospect for extra-articular manifestations. It is believed to occur in genetically susceptible individuals and more common in middle aged women.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis results from abnormally regulated immune responses that lead to inflammation of joints, surrounding tissues and other organs. Often, non-rheumatic diseases that can cause similar features need to be excluded during evaluation.

Rheumatoid arthritis in children may present in one of three forms; a systemic onset arthritis (Still's disease), poly-articular onset arthritis (5 or more joints usually of both large and small affected) or pauci-articular onset arthritis (fewer than 5 of mainly large joints affected) either of which may be rheumatoid factor positive or negative. Those with positive

This is the commonest cause of reported pain to healthcare facilities. More than 80% of people will have at least one episode in their lifetime. Most are benign and will resolve. However, 33%-66% will have a recurrence within a year. It is important to identify red, and yellow flags. It may be acute if it is less than 3 months and chronic if it is more.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-196 .unnumbered}

Individuals may need to be referred to the orthopaedic specialist, neurosurgeon or rheumatologist based on the red and yellow flag criteria above.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder of chronic, widespread pain and tenderness. It typically presents in young women in the third decade or middle-aged women but can affect patients of either sex and at any age.

Fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion and often occurs in patients with other conditions, such as autoimmune inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis. The clinical evaluation may reveal objective evidence for other co-morbid illness, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica and other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders.

No clear pathophysiological mechanism for fibromyalgia has been established, but evidence suggests that there is an abnormality in central pain processing.

Although there is no cure for fibromyalgia, treatment can relieve some of the symptoms. Since symptoms are numerous and vary among patients, treatment programs must be individualized for each patient. Treatment includes patient education, stress reduction, regular exercise and medications. Always combine pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are systemic connective tissue diseases, which are characterized by symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness, reduced muscle strength and chronic inflammation in muscle tissue. These are rare disorders, and affects more women than men. Although the peak age of onset is in the 50s, the disorders can occur at any age. The word "juvenile" is used in the name when a child is affected by myositis.

Adults with inflammatory myopathies, have an increased risk of cancer including cancer of the lung, breast, prostate, and ovaries etc.

The hot swollen joint is a common presentation and has extensive differential diagnosis. Some of the most serious causes are septic arthritis (with a case fatality of 11%) and acute leukemia in children. Late diagnosis and poor treatment leads to joint damage and death.

The commonest affected joint is the big toe, typically due to gout and can be diagnosed on clinical grounds. Patients with a short history of a hot, swollen and tender joint (or joints) with restriction of movement should be regarded as having septic arthritis until proven otherwise. If clinical suspicion is high, then it is imperative to treat as septic arthritis even in the absence of fever.

## Causes {#causes-195 .unnumbered}

-   Septic arthritis

-   Reactive arthritis

This condition, which typically affects males with cardiovascular risk factors and women after menopause, results from the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and periarticular tissues. Gout is characterised by pain and inflammation of the affected joints. It is often, but not always, associated with raised blood uric acid levels and may be present even when the level of uric acid in the blood is normal, while patients with high levels of uric acid may not necessarily have attacks of gout. Individual gout flares are often triggered by acute increases or decreases in uric acid levels which may be associated with acute alcohol ingestion, acute overindulgence in foods high in purines, rapid weight loss, dehydration, or trauma.

## Causes {#causes-196 .unnumbered}

-   Overproduction of uric acid in disorders that cause high cell turnover with release of purines found in cell nuclei

    -   Myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders

    -   Psoriasis

    -   Haemolytic anemias

    -   Cell lysis from chemotherapy, especially those of the haemato- poietic or lymphatic systems

    -   Excessive exercise

    -   Metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol etc.)

-   Impaired excretion of uric acid

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-200 .unnumbered}

Refer patients to a dietician for dietary modification and a weight reducing diet in obese and overweight individuals.

Patients with co-morbid conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, renal impairment or not responding to Allupurinol etc. should be referred to a physician specialist or rheumatologist.

This refers to attacks of synovitis induced by deposition of Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. Most patients are old females.

It behaves like gout in many respects, but unlike gout, attacks persist longer and affect the knee most commonly.

Common risk factors include trauma, surgery, severe illness, parathyroidectomy, pamidronate therapy. Co-morbidities for this condition are usually cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disease that has variable signs and follows a relapsing and remitting course. More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, commonly of childbearing age.

This condition can lead to complications such as acute or chronic renal failure, seizures, psychosis, pleurisy, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, pericarditis, myocarditis, leukopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia and interstitial lung disease.

Management of SLE often depends on the individual patient's disease severity and disease manifestations.

# Chapter {#chapter-22 .unnumbered}

These are injuries in which the scalp, skull, meninges, brain, or the blood vessels within the brain may be affected separately or together. They are a common cause of death and disability especially in young people. With the advent of increased use of motorbikes as public transport, the incidence has gone up. Head injuries may be open or close, mild, moderate or severe. Symptoms and signs, as well as the treatment modality, will depend on the severity of the injury.

Significant head injury is defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of less than 10. However, take even mild injuries seriously as these may evolve with time. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required as the situation can change quickly.

Corticosteriods have demonstrated no benefits in the treatment of acute head injury and are no longer recommended for routine management. Sedatives must also not be given except in cases of transporting an aggressive patient.

## Causes {#causes-198 .unnumbered}

-   Road traffic accidents

-   Falls, especially from heights

-   Blows to the head (fights, including domestic violence, street fights)

-   CSF or blood leakage from the ears/nostrils

-   Pupillary abnormalities - unequal size, pin point or dilated

-   Focal neurological deficits - paralysis, loss of speech or vision

-   Signs of raised intracranial pressure such as deepening coma, a rising blood pressure, slowing of the pulse rate and irregular respiration

-   Other associated injuries

-   Alcoholic breath (in cases of intoxication)

Open fractures imply communication of the fracture haematoma with an epithelial surface like skin, bowel mucosa, bladder mucosa etc. The main problem here is infection, and therefore, every effort should be made to prevent it. In some cases, the degree of bone loss may warrant amputation. Exclude a neurological deficit especially when the injury is extensive. It is prudent to take a photograph of the affected part(s) for documentation and medico-legal purposes.

> **Chapter 23:** Trauma And Injuries

Patients should never be sent for imaging unless haemodynamically stable.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-208 .unnumbered}

Refer all complicated dislocations to an orthopaedic specialist.

Acute orthopaedic infections, which often present as emergencies, include acute osteomyelitis, acute septic arthritis, acute pyomyositis, acute-on-chronic osteomyelitis, and acute-on-chronic septic arthritis.

Acute osteomyelitis and septic arthritis can co-exist in the same individual. They are more common in children and in patients with sickle- cell disease. When the diagnosis is made in an adult, it is important to exclude immune-suppression. *Staph. aureus* and epidermidis account for the majority of the above infections. The commonest route of infection is haematogenous and may originate from skin lesions and ENT infections.

It is important to cover empirically with appropriate antibiotics without necessarily waiting for the culture and sensitivity report.

## Causes {#causes-204 .unnumbered}

-   *Staph. aureus*

-   Staph. epidermidis

## D� For pain relief {#d-for-pain-relief .unnumbered}

(See section on pain relief in 'Acute Orthopaedic Infections')

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-210 .unnumbered}

All patients should be referred as soon as possible to an orthopaedic specialist.

Cellulitis is an infection of skin, specifically the dermis and subcutaneous tissues usually following a break in the skin such as infected wound or prick by a pin, nail, thorn, insect bite or cracks between the toes from athletes's foot.

It may affect any part of the body, but it affects the legs mostly. Obesity and leg swelling are risk factors. It is important to rule out acute osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

> **Chapter 23:** Trauma And Injuries

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and small areas of deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Risk of fractures is higher in elderly individuals with poor walking balance and vision.

Some risk factors include parental hip fractures, advanced age - especially women after menopause, smoking, alcohol abuse, immobilization, inadequate intake of vitamin-D and calcium, prolonged steroid use, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, type-I diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption syndromes, and low femoral neck Bone Mineral Density (BMD).

## Cause {#cause-5 .unnumbered}

-   Imbalance between new bone formation and old bone breakdown

    -   Bone mineral loss

    -   Low bone density

## Symptoms {#symptoms-217 .unnumbered}

-   Back pain

A burn is basically destruction of the skin. In certain situations deeper tissues such as subcutaneous tissue, muscle and bone may be involved. The burn may be superficial or deep depending on the extent of the injury. This condition, which can have devastating effects on affected people, can be prevented most of the time. It affects young and fit people in most cases and they must be managed properly so that they can return to their normal life.

A wound is a break in the continuity of tissues in the body. It may involve overlying epithelium like skin. Wounds are usually caused by injury. Tissues affected include subcutaneous tissue, muscles and even bones. It may be small or large and may be deep or superficial. It may bleed, may be contaminated with dirt and other foreign matter and become infected.

## Causes {#causes-216 .unnumbered}

-   Mechanical agents e.g. cut from cutlass or knife, gunshot, accidents, contusion from blunt injury. Wounds may follow snake or insect bites, animal or human bites

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-222 .unnumbered}

Complicated wounds (e.g. wounds associated with fractures, division of tendons, blood vessels and nerves).

> **[SNAKE BITE]{.underline}**

Most snake bites are non-poisonous. Vipers are the commonest cause of poisonous snake bites in tropical Africa. Others are the cobras and water snakes. All cases of snake bites (venomous/non-venomous) should be observed for at least 6 hours. Identify the type of snake if possible. Don't rely too much on fang marks; however multiple fang marks usually indicate a non-poisonous bite whereas one or two fang marks suggest a poisonous bite. It is important to determine whether envenomation has occurred. The role of tourniquets and incision over the site of the bite are controversial issues and are to be avoided.

## Causes {#causes-217 .unnumbered}

## Treatment Treatment objectives {#treatment-treatment-objectives-172 .unnumbered}

-   To relieve pain and anxiety

-   To support the respiration or circulation if indicated

-   To counteract the spread and effect of the snake venom

-   To prevent secondary infection

## Non-pharmacological treatment {#non-pharmacological-treatment-228 .unnumbered}

> **First Aid**

-   Immobilization/splinting of the affected limb. Do not move the limb that has been bitten - the more it is moved, the faster the poison spreads. Carry the person on a stretcher and tie the limb to a straight piece of wood. If ice is available, wrap pieces in cloth and place it

> **Standard** Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017

# Chapter {#chapter-24 .unnumbered}

Antibiotic prophylaxis refers to the administration of antibiotics in patients to reduce the risk of perioperative sepsis. The main cause of morbidity and mortality in surgery is infectious complications.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases where sepsis is expected and could have disastrous local or generalised effects.

For prophylaxis to be effective, antibiotics must be given before contamination takes place or at the earliest possible time before infection is established. For surgery, therefore, it must be given IV about the time of induction of anaesthesia, so that tissues are saturated with the antibiotic before contamination occurs.

## Causes {#causes-220 .unnumbered}

-   *Staphylococcus aureus*

-   Streptococcus spp.

-   Enterobacteriaceae (GI)

-   Anaerobes (GI)

-   Coagulase negative staphylococci (especially cardiac surgery, and implantation surgery), etc.

# Chapter {#chapter-25 .unnumbered}

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Many factors influence the feeling and emotion of pain and these factors vary from person to person. Pain is what the patient says it is.

Acute pain (as opposed to chronic pain) is defined as lasting for less than three months and is due to noxious stimuli from identifiable causes such as trauma, surgery, or acute illness.

Management of acute pain must be individualized to each patient and should include analgesia as well as treatment of the underlying condition. Special attention must be given, and precautions taken in providing pain relief in children, the elderly, pregnant women, as well as those with concurrent hepatic or renal disease, and those who are opiate tolerant or have a history of substance abuse.

>
> Some of the adverse effects of NSAIDS are:-

-   Excacerbates peptic ulcer disease

-   Causes platelet dysfunction

-   Affects renal function -- decreases renal blood flow

-   Triggers bronchospasm in some asthmatic patients

-   Causes fluid retention

> Thus NSAIDS should **not** be given to several groups of patients, including the following:-

-   Patients with peptic ulcer disease

-   Patients with coagulation or bleeding problems

-   Patients who are at risk of postoperative bleeding eg tonsillectomies

-   Patients with impaired renal function or patients who are at risk of going into renal failure (eg septic patients)

-   Patients with heart failure.

-   Pregnant women, particularly in the third trimester, as it causes early closure

> of the patent ductus arteriolosis

-   Should be used with increased caution in elderly patients.

> There have been concerns about the cardiovascular safety of the COX-2 selec- tive inhibitor group of NSAIDS. The recommendations are that this group of drugs should not be given to patients with ischaemic heart disease or cerebro- vascular disease.

# Chapter {#chapter-26 .unnumbered}

Breast cancer is the commonest cancer affecting women. Early detection of this cancer is possible through monthly breast self- examination and is recommended for women of child-bearing age.

Periodic screening through clinical breast examination is required for women below 40 years (1 in every 3 years) and yearly for women above 40 years. Mammography is recommended every 2 years for women 40 years and above.

Five treatment modalities are available, but each patient's treatment is personalized and depends on the biological characteristics of the tumour, stage of disease and other patient factors. Two percent of breast cancers in Ghana occur in males.

All cases of suspected breast cancer must be referred for specialist attention.

# Chapter {#chapter-27 .unnumbered}

Poisoning represents the harmful effects of toxic amounts of any substance on the body. In many cases, only mild symptoms and signs will develop. However, suspected poisoning should always be considered a medical emergency since the situation may rapidly evolve to become critical.

Many deaths due to poisoning can be prevented with early initiation of good supportive care and general treatment measures. Symptoms and signs of poisoning depend on the specific exposure, and may be local, systemic, or both. Effects may occur immediately, or several hours or days later.

> The severity depends on many factors, including the **type** of substance, the **route** of exposure (ingestion, inhalation, injection, dermal application, etc.), the **dose** and **duration** of exposure, and **patient or environmental factors**.

Obtaining the original container or a sample of the substance is often most helpful, along with a thorough history and physical examination and laboratory analysis to look for characteristic features of poisoning with specific agents.

Judicious use of antidotes for poisoning with specific substances may be added to general treatment measures based on these findings.

A Poison Control Centre exists in Ghana to support health professionals in developing rational and timely strategies for diagnosis and treatment of poisoning.

## Referral Criteria {#referral-criteria-231 .unnumbered}

Refer patients for specialist management if they do not improve with general supportive care or if they require specific antidotes.

# Chapter {#chapter-28 .unnumbered}

Prescribing for older patients presents unique challenges. Many medications need to be used with special caution because of age-related changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drug as well as the physiologic effects of the drug. In particular, physiologic changes in body composition, renal and hepatic functions play vital roles in determining changes in drug levels and the risk of adverse drug events in the elderly.

There is also the issue of multi-morbidity in the elderly, which leads to the prescribing of multiple medications. The more medications prescribed for an elderly person, the higher the risk of adverse effects and other drug interactions.

The 'Beers criteria' (The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel) gives a list of medications considered inappropriate for older patients; either because of ineffectiveness or high risk for adverse events.

## Causes of Adverse Drug Events {#causes-of-adverse-drug-events .unnumbered}

>
> • Periodic 'polythene bag check-ups'; i.e. instruct patients to bring all pill bottles and containers on each medical visit (including empty packets and containers); these should be checked against the medication list
>
> • Patients should be made aware of potential drug confusions i.e. sound-alike names, look-alike pills, and combination medications

# Chapter {#chapter-29 .unnumbered}

Local anaesthetic (LA) agents are drugs that reversibly block nerve transmission. They are used to provide anaesthesia to specific areas of the body and can also be used for analgesia.

Local anaesthetics also affect transmission in motor nerves; hence, motor weakness may occur following a local anaesthetic, depending on the site of application.

Adrenaline is added to local anaesthetics to delay absorption and thus prolong their action. The usual concentration of adrenaline added to a local anaesthetic is 1:200,000.

Local anaesthetics with adrenaline should never be used where the blood supply is by end arteries e.g. should not be used for digital nerve blocks. They are also contraindicated in intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA).

Commonly used LAs in our sub-region are lignocaine and bupivacaine.

## A. Lidocaine (Lignocaine) {#a.-lidocaine-lignocaine .unnumbered}

> • Advantage - rapid onset of action
>
> • Duration - about 1 hour
>
> • Maximum dose of plain lidocaine - 3 mg/kg (approx. 200 mg in adult)
>
> • Maximum dose of lidocaine with adrenaline - 7 mg/kg
>
> • Lidocaine is not recommended for spinal anaesthesia

## B� Bupivacaine {#b-bupivacaine .unnumbered}

> • Advantage - long acting
>
> • Disadvantages - cardiotoxic, slow onset of action
>
> • Maximum dose is 2 mg/kg (for both plain and with adrenaline added)

## C. Ropivacaine {#c.-ropivacaine .unnumbered}

> • Advantage - long acting, less cardiotoxic
>
> • Maximum dose is 3 mg/kg
>
> **Chapter 30:** Local Anaesthetic Agents

## Uses of local anaesthetic agents {#uses-of-local-anaesthetic-agents .unnumbered}

> • Topical
>
> • Local infiltration
>
> • Nerve blocks
>
> • Intravenous regional anaesthesia
>
> • Spinal anaesthesia (subarachnoid block)
>
> • Epidural anaesthesia/analgesia
>
> • Nebulisation for anaesthetizing upper airway
>
> • Inravenous preparation of lignocaine used as an antiarrhythmic

## Prevention of local anaesthetic toxicity {#prevention-of-local-anaesthetic-toxicity .unnumbered}

> • Always aspirate before injecting, to prevent inadvertent intravascular injection
>
> • Do not inject large volumes at a time
>
> • Caution when injecting into areas of high vascularity

## Symptoms and signs of local anaesthesia toxicity {#symptoms-and-signs-of-local-anaesthesia-toxicity .unnumbered}

> • Peri-oral tingling, tinnitus, light headedness
>
> • Visual disturbances, slurred speech
>
> • Altered consciousness, seizures, loss of consciousness, respiratory
>
> arrest
>
> • Hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest

## Treatment of local anaesthetic toxicity {#treatment-of-local-anaesthetic-toxicity .unnumbered}

> • Stop injection of LA
>
> • Start ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) of resuscitation
>
> • Give 100% oxygen. If necessary intubate patient
>
> • Give Midazolam (3-5 mg) or diazepam (5-10 mg) to treat seizures. If seizures persist, an anaesthetist can give thiopentone 1-2 mg/kg or more midazolam and paralyse, intubate and ventilate patient
>
> • Treat cardiovascular instability with IV fluids, inotropes, and when bupivacaine or ropivacaine has been used, give Intralipid 20% using regime below
>
> • If cardiac arrest occurs, start CPR and call for help

## Use of 20% intralipid in treatment of local anaesthetic toxicity (follow- ing bupivacaine or ropivacaine) {#use-of-20-intralipid-in-treatment-of-local-anaesthetic-toxicity-follow--ing-bupivacaine-or-ropivacaine .unnumbered}

In addition to other resuscitative measures outlined above:

> • Give an intravenous bolus of Intralipid 20%, 1.5 ml/kg fast (approx. 100 ml for a 70kg patient)
>
> • Start an infusion of 20% Intralipid at 0.25 ml/kg/min (approx. 400 ml over 20 mins for a 70 kg patient)
>
> • Repeat initial bolus twice at 5 minute intervals, if adequate circulation
>
> has not been restored
>
> • Maximum dose of 12 ml/kg of Intralipid 20% should not be exceeded

# Chapter {#chapter-30 .unnumbered}

A seriously ill child is one whose vitals are compromised. A structured approach in determining the cause and subsequent successful management of the child is necessary. Rapid assessment and urgent intervention are the major requirements in the approach.

Triaging soon after their arrival in hospital for emergency signs like severe respiratory distress or coma and priority signs like high temperature, restlessness or severe pain is important.

Presentations of serious illness may be classified under the following problem areas; airway/breathing, cardiac, shock and neurological disability.

The structured approach includes:

> • Primary assessment
>
> • Resuscitation
>
> • Secondary assessment
>
> • Emergency treatment
>
> • Definitive care
>
> **[AIRWAY/BREATHING PROBLEMS]{.underline}**

## Causes {#causes-224 .unnumbered}

> • Severe Pneumonia
>
> • Bronchiolitis
>
> • Upper airway obstruction or stridor
>
> • Others

## Signs And Symptoms {#signs-and-symptoms .unnumbered}

> • Depends on condition

## Approach {#approach .unnumbered}

> • Primary assessment
>
> • Can child speak? Indicates airway patency
>
> • Can infant cry? Indicates airway patency
>
> • Adequacy of breathing assessed by recession, respiratory rate, grunting, inspiratory or expiratory noises, flaring of the alae nasi
>
> **Chapter 31:** Structured Approach to the Seriously Ill Child
>
> • Effectiveness of breathing is assessed by breath sounds, chest expansion and abdominal excursion
>
> • Final effects of inadequate respiration are determined from the heart rate, skin colour and mental status
>
> • Pulse oximetry desirable. A saturation of less than 90% while breathing air or less than 95% while breathing oxygen is very low
>
> • High flow oxygen should be given to all children with respiratory difficulty or hypoxia. In a child with inadequate ventilation, bag valve mask oxygenation or intubation may be required

## Investigations {#investigations-234 .unnumbered}

> • Chest X-ray
>
> • Arterial blood gas
>
> • Peak flow (if asthma a possibility)

## Management {#management .unnumbered}

If a chin lift or jaw thrust can secure airway then do so, otherwise consider intubation

RESPIRATORY; if bubbly noises heard, airway full of secretions, suction required

Harsh stridor with barking cough and severe respiratory distress, more likely to be upper airway obstruction, nebulise with adrenaline (5ml of 1:1000 in oxygen)

If symptoms had a sudden onset and there is history of inhalation, consider laryngeal foreign body. Call an ENT surgeon immediately

Children with a history of asthma and respiratory distress require nebulized salbutamol 2.5 mg or 5 mg if 7 years plus and oxygen

> **[CIRCULATION/CARDIOVASCULAR]{.underline}**

When normal capillary refill time is more than 2 seconds, then there is no problem with cardiac output. Cardiac arrest predominantly occurs secondary to hypoxia or hypovolaemia. Primary myocardial disease is rare.

## Causes {#causes-225 .unnumbered}

> • Heart failure

> • Arrhythmias (heart rhythm abnormalities)

## Approach {#approach-1 .unnumbered}

> • Primary assessment, with regard to circulation;
>
> • Heart rate

> **[SHOCK (INADEQUATE CIRCULATION)]{.underline}**

## Causes {#causes-226 .unnumbered}

> • Severe gastroenteritis
>
> • Diarrhoea
>
> • Cardiac disease

## Management {#management-2 .unnumbered}

Resuscitation -- every child in shock should have oxygen at a high flow rate. Venous or intraosseous access should be obtained and an infusion of normal saline at 20 ml/kg given

In drowsiness with sighing respirations check blood sugar and acid base balance. Treat diabetic ketoacidosis with IV normal saline and insulin In an unconscious child with pinpoint pupils consider opiate

poisoning. Try naloxone.

Gastrointestinal: Usually presents with shock from fluid loss. Symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain or bloody stools; signs may include abdominal tenderness or a mass. Consider surgical intervention

Give boluses of fluid to shocked children if first one not effective.

Consider IV antibiotics in shocked children with no obvious fluid loss
